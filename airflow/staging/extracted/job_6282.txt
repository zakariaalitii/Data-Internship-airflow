From the humblest NYC slice and a cup of joe to museum-quality lattes (and yes, avocado toast), each order represents a long paper trail and a series of truck deliveries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a rapidly growing market presence, Cheetah is already streamlining the daily workflow of hundreds of restaurants and small business owners. Using Cheetah\u2019s services, they manage millions of dollars in monthly purchasing, while Cheetah eliminates the burden of costly sales reps and inflexible, inefficient distribution centers. Partnering with the largest suppliers in the US, Cheetah is bringing the Silicon Valley user experience to an industry that hasn\u2019t evolved in decades. In the process, we\u2019re helping to reintroduce the small business owner to the small farmer, global supply chains to familiar faces, and delivery and logistics workers to increased mobility and new opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Cheetah, a relentless executive team has set out to change this reality, armed with deep industry and entrepreneurial experience, personal conviction, and $70M in funding from Eclipse, Floodgate, and the early backers of Facebook, Lyft and Airbnb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unencumbered by the old-school business models and practices, Cheetah has introduced unprecedented transparency in pricing and inventory to the SMB marketplace. In doing so, Cheetah allows the people who form the backbone of local economies to focus on what they love: cooking great food and providing excellent service. From the convenience of their phones, business owners can now order whatever they need, discover new, rare or seasonal specialty products, and prioritize their customers. No more rushing to unload your double-parked van, or waiting anxiously for a truck to show up with your weekly allotment of boxes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Data Scientist (Operations)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheetah is looking for a data scientist with experience designing and optimizing logistics and warehouse operations. This function is vital to the long-term success of the company and ensures that Cheetah warehouses are operating in an efficient way and customers receive their deliveries at the optimal time and freshness, while also minimizing operation / transportation costs. In this role, you will have the chance to redefine how restaurants and small businesses receive the supplies they need to run their organizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this role you must be driven to understand complex problems and find unique, out-of-the-box solutions. For example, you will be responsible for building and implementing the models that predict the transit and service time of each delivery, optimize transportation cost, and inform the product team on which new customer facing features (e.g. delivery windows) to create. We want someone who loves modeling and writing code, diving into difficult problems and creating exceptional automated systems. This individual will work with the engineering team to deploy and evaluate model testing, and generate other hypothesis based experiments. You will define, measure and utilize metrics to build business cases and present them to your team and senior management. This role will be an integral part of the data team and will ensure Cheetah provides customers with an unparalleled delivery experience by using data mining, mathematical and statistical modeling, and machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Define and collect relevant data to perform further analyses on logistics and warehouse operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Develop, implement and optimize algorithms for Cheetah daily operations, such as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Warehouse slot allocation and pick path optimization.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Product assortment and vendor type selection among regular-stocked, Just-In-Time, dropship, and consignment vendors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Inventory outbound / inbound and labour scheduling.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fleet assignment and routing optimization (including backhauls).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dynamic delivery windows selections.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Work with the engineering team to build processes to support fast, iterative experimentation - both for model creation and product development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Collaborate with business intelligence teams to develop reports and visualization dashboards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Build financial models to project key business metrics - on-time deliveries, cost per drop, error in delivery predictions - and develop KPIs to track performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Qualifications:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;-3+ years of professional experience with machine learning, predictive modeling, and optimization techniques, handling large, complex, data sets.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;-MS or PhD in a quantitative field such as Industrial Engineering, Operations Research, Computer Science, or a related Engineering degree.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;-Proven track record in solving business problems through fact based, scientific, methods.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;-Experience in Python /&amp;nbsp;R, SQL, and similar languages to manipulate and transform data into insights, as well as developing algorithms for deployment to production systems.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;-Deep understanding of linear / non-linear optimization, simulation, machine learning, and statistical analyses.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;-Strong verbal, writing, and presentation skills, as well as the ability to persuade, inspire, and motivate others.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Must have the ability to summarize key insights for both technical and non-technical audiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits and Perks:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Flexible working schedule / location&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Company happy hours, team building events, and intramural sports teams&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Unlimited paid time off&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Comprehensive medical/dental/vision insurance and commuter benefits&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-401(k) plan and flexible spending benefits&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-The opportunity to work alongside a visionary team during Cheetah\u2019s rapid growth!&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "Cheetah", "sameAs": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/gocheetah", "logo": "https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C560BAQGMuIm2Pz8gAg/company-logo_200_200/0/1591197581104?e=1638403200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=ib6IDTFAqkVDVT1TjehHwRO_o_egyGwlUcz0n0vTUyI"}, "identifier": {"@type": "PropertyValue", "name": "Cheetah"}, "image": "https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C560BAQGMuIm2Pz8gAg/company-logo_100_100/0/1591197581104?e=1638403200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=7ZPLG05BGwH6SpqIU0LAxqrU6VmtAMAGvJWmYV2avf4", "industry": "Food &amp; Beverages,Logistics and Supply Chain", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "US", "addressLocality": "Pleasanton", "addressRegion": "CA", "postalCode": "94588", "streetAddress": null}, "latitude": 37.658436, "longitude": -121.877}, "skills": "", "title": "Data Scientist - Operations", "validThrough": "2021-09-25T16:53:15.000Z", "educationRequirements": {"@type": "EducationalOccupationalCredential", "credentialCategory": "bachelor degree"}, "experienceRequirements": {"@type": "OccupationalExperienceRequirements", "monthsOfExperience": 36}}
