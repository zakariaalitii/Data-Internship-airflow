It\u2019s what you do when you get there that matters. Lockheed Martin builds satellites and spacecraft that do amazing things in space for government and commercial customers. Connecting people. Advancing discovery. And protecting what matters most. Lockheed Martin-built satellites give earlier warning of severe weather, connect troops on the battlefield, and deliver GPS directions to a billion people worldwide.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As we look to the future, we\u2019re driving innovations to help our customers do even more in orbit. That\u2019s why we\u2019re crafting smarter satellites that operate like smartphones in the sky, with apps that can be updated in orbit so they can adapt as mission needs on the ground change.
