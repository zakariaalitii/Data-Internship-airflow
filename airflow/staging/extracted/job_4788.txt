More than 12 million people use Screencastify every week (!!!) to record, edit and share all sorts of amazing videos. We like to think that we've democratized video creation by making it simpler and more affordable than ever before.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In K-12 classrooms around the world, teachers and students are using Screencastify to create instructional videos, record presentations, give better feedback, and much much more.

A team of less than 5 built a product used by millions of people. We've achieved more than teams 10x our size by solving problems that matter and putting product quality above all else.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Tackle our most interesting and impactful problems.

Absolutely no boredom.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Join us at a magical time. We're profitable and support tens of millions of users with a small team, which gives us a huge green field to work with. You'll join at the perfect time to shape how we grow from here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;What you\u2019ll do&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Build new product features from start to finish through conception, research, maintenance, and polish&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Familiarize yourself with browser APIs for recording and processing video&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Build improvements to performance, reliability, and product polish&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Build and improve processes and internal tools with simplicity and productivity in mind &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;You\u2019re perfect for this role if you&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have 2-4+ years building and maintaining quality user interfaces that have reached a large audience, ideally while the product is experiencing rapid growth&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have experience developing full-stack with Node.js, Angular, React or similar&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can readily learn most technologies as you go&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Care about the business implications of anything you build. You're not just going after cool stuff \u2014 you understand the balance between craft, speed, and the bottom line.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are flexible, dedicated, and curious&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; Competitive compensation. We take a data-driven approach to our compensation strategy so all employees are paid competitively and equitably.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; 401k plan. We want to invest in present you and future you, which is why we offer a generous 401k match with our 401k plan.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Minimum vacation policy. We recognize the importance of taking personal time off, and require our employees to take at least 15 vacation days per year. You\u2019re also encouraged to take additional paid time off, as needed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Flexible work policy. Gone are the days of being in an office from 9-5, Monday through Friday. We recognize there are better ways to measure productivity than counting the number of hours you\u2019re in the office and that sometimes the office isn\u2019t the best place to be productive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Parental leave. Generous paid time off for parents to bond with the newest addition to their family!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Medical, dental, and vision insurance.

Each department has a professional development budget and employees are encouraged to take workshops, attend webinars, join associations, and anything else that could help grow their careers.
