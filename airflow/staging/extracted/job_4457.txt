Delivering this digital transformation poses challenges for security, visibility and control. Our industry is rapidly coalescing around Secure Access Service Edge (SASE), a cloud-based security architecture. SASE combines networking and security-as-a-service capabilities into a single offering that greatly simplifies this transformation for our customers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One of the fundamental concepts of SASE is the convergence of network services such as software-defined wide area networks (SD-WAN) with network security technologies such as secure web gateway (SWG), cloud access security broker (CASB), data loss prevention (DLP), browser isolation, zero trust network access (ZTNA), and SSL inspection.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Symantec Web Security Service (WSS) is the foundation of the Symantec SASE solution. It integrates multiple advanced security technologies and makes them available from the cloud. WSS runs on a high-performance, fully redundant cloud-native infrastructure. This network, among the largest and best connected in the world, is edge-optimized for remote employees working from home and on mobile devices.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Responsibilities&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The team in Waterloo, Ontario plays a vital role in defining the next generation Symantec SASE architecture.
