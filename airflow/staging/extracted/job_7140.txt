Multiple compute options provide the flexibility to run the most demanding workloads, as well as less compute-intensive applications, in a secure and highly available cloud environment. Customers can self-service provision virtual machines right alongside bare metal servers and clusters on the same virtual cloud networks, through a unified web console, APIs, CLI or via industry-standard tools such as Terraform and Chef. OCI's approach gives the customer choices for storage us industry leading local NVME storage or elastic network block storage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Oracle Kubernetes Engine (OKE) team builds the OCI service that runs our managed Kubernetes experience. It is in use by a variety of internal and external customers, and we're actively adding features - from Kubernetes, to deeper integrations with OCI, and to better allow cluster management.
