{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "JobPosting", "datePosted": "2021-07-22T01:35:45.000Z", "description": "Are you a seasoned leader hoping to apply your experience to the next exciting frontier in technology sales?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now is the time to join the most exciting company in Cloud and Digital Workspace.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Cloud is here, and everything has changed. In the age of mobile and cloud, consumer devices and application experiences are shaping how businesses drive digital transformation. This affects the ways companies engage their customers, employees, and partners, and no longer can we reliably depend on singular, heavily instrumented, on-premise applications. Instead, computing today requires a broad, multi-channel strategy that spans on-premise systems and multiple cloud service providers. Doing it right, while not forsaking traditional on-prem needs, requires longevity and experience; the very kind that VMware has.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;VMware solves these cloud generation problems with a comprehensive portfolio of integrated solutions. The platform is comprised of a wide range of products and services; covering many of the capabilities required by exceptional IT operators and developers. VMware earns its seat at the table because of this broad set of capabilities, and IT executives can\u2019t help but pay attention to the innovations that VMware brings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Essential to our customer\u2019s success is the role of the SE leader; to lead the Solution Engineers that guide those customers through the intricacies of VMware\u2019s solutions, and prove technical fitness to their business needs. As a Sr. SE Manager, you will ensure proper development of the SEs across VMware technologies, domain expertise, and salesmanship. You will lead with credibility, ensuring that you are also fully developed across these categories. You will be highly engaged with customers yourself, helping to articulate VMware\u2019s strategy at a higher level than your direct reports. You will support the company\u2019s strategy, encouraging your team to execute the mission as it pertains to their function. And finally, you will craft a strong franchise with the Region Director(s) you map to, running the business as though you are executive leaders of a small company.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At VMware, we have the right strategy at the right time. We're a highly profitable company; increasingly rare among our peers. We benefit from insightful leadership that will carry us well into the future. We consistently place in Forbes' Best 100 Companies to Work For. We have a strong culture of diversity and inclusion, and we'd love for you to be at VMware too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Responsibilities&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Work tightly with assigned Region Director(s) to identify \u201cline-of-sight\u201d to the annual plan. The region plan should incorporate all dimensions of the business, including how to overachieve the target, customer whitespace to pursue, how partners and ecosystem are leveraged, marketing, networking through industry associations, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stay up to date on current events and be a student of the industry and culture.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Assist in delivering compelling executive briefings.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Articulate the ways VMware solutions provide increased business value and improved technical capability when compared to our competitors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Train and mentor sales peers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be responsible for the performance and development of direct reports.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Assist in technically closing complex and competitive opportunities by providing critical oversight of those directly engaged.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Celebrate key wins.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maintain appropriate knowledge in assigned technology on an ongoing basis.
