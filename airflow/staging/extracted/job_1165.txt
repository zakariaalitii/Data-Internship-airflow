We get to do great user experience work here and believe in a collaborative working style where researchers, designers, product managers, and engineers work together to experiment and riff off each other\u2019s curiosity. Our rapidly growing global team of diverse and talented researchers and designers are made up of fun and caring people who bring unique skill sets, perspectives, and personalities to a product team that respects autonomy and advocates for our customers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We believe great products are built by deeply understanding our customers \u2014 who they are, what motivates them, why they behave the way they do, and what they think of our brand, our products, our services, and the overall market.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What We Need&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Shutterstock is on an amazing journey to pursue our vision beyond that of stock photography, video, and audio. We are building an intelligent, creative platform where our customers ideate, publish, distribute and measure the performance of their creative supported by bleeding edge technology and AI capabilities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We need help dreaming up and building out some really cool products by understanding who our customers are, how they use those products, how to make the experience valuable, and win their hearts and minds. This requires a researcher who is strong in generative research methods, as well as evaluative. A person who can serve as the voice of the customer, act as a customer experience advocate, and help drive understanding and empathy for our customers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Day To Day&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; Lead the generative research initiatives, including planning, recruiting, and running sessions (i.e. user interviews, observations, participatory design). Including collaborating with Product to identify new opportunities and test hypotheses to ensure we deliver value to our customers. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Synthesizing research findings with product designers and product managers to identify opportunities, patterns, and trends. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Lead evaluative research sessions to validate design concepts or test the usability and satisfaction of prototypes, beta or live solutions (i.e. concept testing, moderated/unmoderated usability testing). This includes working with junior researchers on planning, recruiting, and running sessions. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Join workshops where design, product, research, and engineering teams will collaborate to clarify or come up with solutions together. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Leverage analytics to understand What is happening to inform research work to understand the Why. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Coordinate with the marketing research, testing, business intelligence, and data science teams on cross-org research initiatives. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Work with other researchers to maintain our research repository. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Evangelize and mentor peers on research best practices. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Extensively post GIFs and emojis throughout Slack channels. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does the first six months look like?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; Work with the VP of UX, SVP of Product, and Product Directors to design and define our Product Discovery process and overall research strategy. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Support the VP of UX on building and growing the research team. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Take the lead on running research sessions with Product Designers and Product Managers to create a set of personas. These will guide the vision of the products, its features, and help bring empathy to the larger team. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Collaborate with Product Designers and Product Managers on creating experience maps for each persona. Then collaborate with a Product Manager to map opportunities along the journeys. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What You Bring To The Role&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; You have around five years or more of professional experience leading research initiatives across a range of products, services, workflows, and/or tools launched in consumer or business SaaS applications. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; You are a proactive self-starter, comfortable with taking what is ambiguous and making it tangible by leveraging design thinking techniques using research and sense making methods. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; You have a strong portfolio that showcases your work, provides details of your process, explains your role on projects, and shows the impact of your work. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Shutterstock Principles &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;We are one team collectively focused on creating an unrivaled experience for our Customers and Contributors.
