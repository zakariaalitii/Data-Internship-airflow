The problem is already very real and immediate; for example, bloodstream infection leading to sepsis is now responsible for more than half of all deaths in hospitals and is the most expensive condition treated in hospitals. Sepsis mortality rate increases &amp;gt;6% every hour without effective antibiotic treatment. Yet, despite the life and death urgency, and healthcare cost impacts, current methodologies require 3 days to determine the correct antibiotic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specific Diagnostics has developed a breakthrough solution to rapidly determine the effective antibiotic treatment for bloodstream and other acute infections. Used for bloodstream infection Specific\u2019s solution provides results 2 days sooner than existing methods, saving patients suffering from drug-resistant infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have been funded by nearly $30 M in non-dilutive government sponsored research support and recently $17.5 M in venture capital.
