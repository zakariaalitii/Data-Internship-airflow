Today the company runs one of the world\u2019s largest networks that powers approximately 25 million Internet properties, for customers ranging from individual bloggers to SMBs to Fortune 500 companies. Cloudflare protects and accelerates any Internet application online without adding hardware, installing software, or changing a line of code. Internet properties powered by Cloudflare all have web traffic routed through its intelligent global network, which gets smarter with every request. As a result, they see significant improvement in performance and a decrease in spam and other attacks. Cloudflare was named to Entrepreneur Magazine\u2019s Top Company Cultures list and ranked among the World\u2019s Most Innovative Companies by Fast Company.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We realize people do not fit into neat boxes. We are looking for curious and empathetic individuals who are committed to developing themselves and learning new skills, and we are ready to help you do that. We cannot complete our mission without building a diverse and inclusive team. We hire the best people based on an evaluation of their potential and support them throughout their time at Cloudflare. Come join us!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About The Department&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Cloudflare\u2019s Engineering Team builds and runs the software that handles trillions of requests per month. We also build and run the internal tools that builds and runs our software. The Engineering Team is split into two groups: one handles product development and the other handles operations. Product development covers both new features and functionality and scaling our existing software to meet the challenges of a massively growing customer base. The operations team handles one of the world\u2019s largest networks with data centers in 102 cities worldwide.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you'll do&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Tackling real world security problems that affect our customers, building &amp;amp; leveraging massive threat intelligence data, with the help of data science and machine learning, and finally building scalable &amp;amp; performant distributed software that runs on thousands of machines all over the globe. All the while making a real impact and difference in the world. You will be responsible for designing, building, and scaling one of the fastest growing security products at Cloudflare -- Bot Management. You will work with our global data in excess of 10 million events per second (and growing fast!), and designing and implementing software systems, machine learning platforms, and AI models to leverage the data in detecting and mitigating abusive HTTP L7 layer traffic. Tech stack includes Go, Python, JavaScript, Rust, Lua, Kafka, Kubernetes, ClickHouse, PostgreSQL, Jupyter notebook.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Examples Of Desirable Skills, Knowledge And Experience&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Develop highly-scalable classifiers, models and algorithms and tools to filter abuse or fraudulent HTTP requests&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Train machine learning and deep learning models on a computing cluster to perform abuse and threat detection &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Develop state-of-the-art algorithms in deep learning (convolutional neural networks) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Experience writing high-quality data processing code in Go, Java, Python, or other high-performance languages &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Strong systems-level debugging &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Prior experience or interest in Web Security, HTTP protocols, and JavaScript is a huge plus! &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Knowledge and experience with statistical inference, and AI in general is a huge plus &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonus Points&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; Experience productionizing Machine Learning models &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Knowledge and experience with columnar database like Clickhouse &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Experience building REST APIs for analytics services &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Experience with cluster and configuration management systems such as Docker, Salt &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Familiarity writing and optimizing advanced SQL queries &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Good Linux/UNIX systems knowledge &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Makes Cloudflare Special?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;We\u2019re not just a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company. We\u2019re a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company with a soul. Fundamental to our mission to help build a better Internet is protecting the free and open Internet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project Galileo&lt;/strong&gt; : We equip politically and artistically important organizations and journalists with powerful tools to defend themselves against attacks that would otherwise censor their work, technology already used by Cloudflare\u2019s enterprise customers--at no cost.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Athenian Project &lt;/strong&gt; : We created Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Path Forward Partnership&lt;/strong&gt; : Since 2016, we have partnered with Path Forward, a nonprofit organization, to create 16-week positions for mid-career professionals who want to get back to the workplace after taking time off to care for a child, parent, or loved one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.1.1.1&lt;/strong&gt; : We released 1.1.1.1 to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here\u2019s the deal - we don\u2019t store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by our privacy commitment and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sound like something you\u2019d like to be a part of?
