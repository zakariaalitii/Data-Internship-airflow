Our teams work on the breadth of networking offerings (Networking hardware, optical and IP networks that span subsea, terrestrial and metro fiber, Hybrid services enabling VPN and MPLS connectivity from customers' on premise network to our cloud, Edge services enabling optimized peering and routing, SDN products to enable customers to run their on-premise services in the cloud with Vnet, Load Balancer, Security Groups and Services, Application Gateways, Virtual Appliances to easily mimic on-premise architectures, and DNS services to reach and traffic manage services.&lt;br&gt;Software Defined Networking (SDN) enables customers to realize and control the network they desire for their workload in the cloud. This includes traditional enterprise network functions like ACLs, firewalls, load balancers, IPS/IDS, DoS protection, that customers want to realize in the network for their VMs in the cloud. All these need to be delivered on a shared, very high speed but low-complexity physical network based on merchant silicon. And that is where the software comes in - all these can be realized and delivered in software by building a virtual network on top of physical network, using the virtualized host as the scale-out engine for all our policy, allowing the underlying physical network to be cheap and extremely fast. Creating a new, software controlled virtualized network, optimized for the cloud, represents a once-in-ten-years technological shift. The entire industry is realizing the SDN vision and jumping into it.&lt;br&gt;This is an exciting opportunity to be front and center of the two key disruptions happening: cloud and SDN.
