For us, life&amp;apos;s not about a job, it&amp;apos;s about purpose. We feel real change starts with conversation. Here, your voice matters. Come as you are and together we&amp;apos;ll do what&amp;apos;s right (not what&amp;apos;s easy) to serve the public conversation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Job Description&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who We Are&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The Media Infrastructure organization strives to push the boundaries of what media can be included in a tweet, and we own the infrastructure used to run online A/B testing and experimentation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We work with both online and offline systems like Hadoop and with different media serving technologies and content delivery systems! We work across on-prem, and cloud-based clusters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;How You\u2019ll Work&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;You\u2019ll embed deeply with your Software Engineering (SWE) counterparts and take an active role as a co-owner of production services to ensure services are built, maintained, and operated in a reliable and scalable way. You will be part of the successful delivery of new features and services, as well as the day-to-day successful operation of existing services.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You\u2019ll collaborate with SWE partners to drive operational health improvements, root cause analysis, postmortem discussions, and their associated remediations that serve to improve reliability and sub-linearly scale operations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Partner with both SWE and SRE to demonstrate tools, processes, and techniques to reduce business risk. Perform infrastructure &amp;amp; configuration management, deploys, capacity modeling &amp;amp; planning, and incident mitigation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Identify common patterns in challenges with operating services in production, partner with others to design and implement reusable solutions and/or other cross-functional work that drives down the complexity, difficulty, costs, and risks of operating the business.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What You&amp;apos;ll Do&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;We are looking for SREs who are passionate about highly performant user-facing services, have a desire to grow themselves and learn new technologies, love working in collaborative teams, and committed to serving their customers. You don\u2019t need to have mastered Hadoop to join this team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Your Responsibilities Include&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Play a leading role within engineering partner teams for GCP and AWS Infrastructure adoption and standard methodologies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Traditional SRE/Operational support scopes like tooling and automation, monitoring, workflow management, maintaining and improving data pipelines, CI/CD, monitoring, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Partner and support existing Media teams with operational guidance and expertise on various project initiatives.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Participate in capacity planning and scaling.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ensure media is served in a highly performant way that can also handle viral traffic surges.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Support other engineers at Twitter by owning and extending the online experimentation and A/B testing frameworks that inform production rollouts and experiments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Qualifications&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;4+ years experience handling services in a large scale distributed systems environment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Expert knowledge of Linux operating system internals, filesystems, disk/storage technologies, and storage protocols, and networking stack.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Expert knowledge of systems programming (bash and shell tools) and practical, proven knowledge of at least one higher-level language (Python, Go, or Scala).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Comfortable working with both on-prem and cloud-based infrastructure (AWS, GCP) in terms of deployment, support, monitoring, administration, and troubleshooting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience using containerization software such as Kubernetes, Docker, Mesos.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Proven understanding of systems and application design, including the operational trade-offs of various designs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be comfortable operating as a member of a team, and work well with a myriad of personalities at all levels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Solid understanding of distributed systems design, scaling, durability, and security.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience with Kubeflow, Scatter-gather systems, Hadoop is a plus, but not a requirement.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "Twitter", "sameAs": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/twitter", "logo": "https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C560BAQHRsTnqOuV4tA/company-logo_200_200/0/1622574251992?e=1635984000&amp;v=beta&amp;t=yRicJOjUo-QwlESxdBXU3_YjVs77mmFRxY_uEFig_3c"}, "identifier": {"@type": "PropertyValue", "name": "Twitter", "value": "aa9f5bfbb522476fc7a5ee4287d75d8a"}, "image": "https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C560BAQHRsTnqOuV4tA/company-logo_100_100/0/1622574251992?e=1635984000&amp;v=beta&amp;t=IYztRdLEHThliA04_6jOJZ4s7hFnDKLHAuObLxh4wX0", "industry": "Internet", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "US", "addressLocality": "San Francisco", "addressRegion": "CA", "postalCode": "94121", "streetAddress": null}, "latitude": 37.78008, "longitude": -122.42016}, "skills": "", "title": "Senior Site Reliability Engineer, Media Infrastructure", "validThrough": "2021-09-01T22:02:37.000Z", "educationRequirements": {"@type": "EducationalOccupationalCredential", "credentialCategory": "bachelor degree"}, "experienceRequirements": {"@type": "OccupationalExperienceRequirements", "monthsOfExperience": 48}, "jobLocationType": "TELECOMMUTE", "applicantLocationRequirements": {"@type": "Country", "name": "United States"}}
