Love what you do. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; At Workday, we help the world\u2019s largest organizations adapt to what\u2019s next by bringing finance, HR, and planning into a single enterprise cloud. We work hard, and we\u2019re serious about what we do. But we like to have fun, too. We put people first, celebrate diversity, drive innovation, and do good in the communities where we live and work. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Team&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Do you dig data? Scads and scads of data. We guess you probably do since you\u2019re looking at a Machine Learning job ad. Payroll data \u2026 super dry stuff, huh? Well, truth is, only a subset of the population uses online shopping, or orders food deliveries, or binges TV series. But everyone, EVERYONE!, who gets paid has payroll data. More of it every month, every day, every hour. Payroll has more or less done the same thing since it was the first ever automated business application built in the 1950s. But we believe that using modern Machine Learning techniques, we can transform the way that Payroll is processed. So if you like working with huge volumes of vital data and you are interested in a goal of making people\u2019s lives better by ensuring they get paid correctly, accurately, swiftly for the work they do, we\u2019d love to talk to you!&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Role&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  As an ML Engineer, you will help develop data-driven, automated, comprehensive solutions using modern software and data engineering stacks to enable training, deployment, and lifecycle management of a variety of ML models \u2013 supervised and unsupervised, deep learning and classical etc. You will work closely with product managers, software engineers to deliver ML solutions that provide payroll administrators and users enormous value and efficiency. Your work will also ensure that users have the best payroll processing experience by providing predictive analytics and recommendations.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  You will use Workday\u2019s ML development environment and resources on rich HR and Payroll datasets to deliver value that transforms the way our customers use Payroll products. You will apply your highly technical problem solving, creative thinking, beautiful mind using the latest ML techniques and toolsets and make a huge impact on the world's largest enterprises that use Workday to process payroll for millions of employees.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;In this role, you would:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;  Be part of a team of data scientists and software developers  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;  Learn all about HR and Payroll data and processes\u00a0  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;  Own data exploration and transformation, feature engineering, design and enhance ML models/frameworks that deliver anomaly detection, prediction and recommendation solutions for Payroll application.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;  Develop, maintain and enhance ML solutions that are highly usable, scalable and secure.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;  Grow your career in a great place to work and a forward-looking company.\u00a0  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About You&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;  B.S. or M.S. in relevant fields (Computer Science, Mathematics, Engineering).
