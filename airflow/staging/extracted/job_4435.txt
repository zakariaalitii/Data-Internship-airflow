They understand the application of non-literal imagery and how to apply complex mathematical algorithms to extract relevant intelligence information. They have developed numerous testing plans to evaluate the performance of a variety of types of algorithms when applied to radar data in order to support Order of Battle. The IS possess the knowledge of how to design performance testing to verify and validate a broad range of radar based algorithms. The results of this developed process shall be incorporated into all future radar based algorithms development for application to NSG radar data.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The IS will work as a team member of the NSG Radar Ground program using best practices from other NGA programs and organizations working on algorithm verification and validation.Providing matrixed support to the ATT Sensor Engagement Lead for Radar, the IS serves as a key member of the customers technical team and a focal point for mission engineering, mission integration, and development oversight.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Duties May Include&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Engage with customers and users to define future enterprise-level capabilities&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lead or participate in customer and program strategic and tactical planning activities relevant to Radar&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lead or participate in the development of radar process that will be included in the overall enterprise system architectures to test, verify and validate Radar algorithms&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Assess new technologies and their overall performance&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Conduct Analysis of Alternatives (AoAs) and provide data-driven recommendations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leverage SAR experiences to provide insight on the development of key technical products, such as capability roadmaps, CONOPS documents, and white papers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leverage SAR experiences to provide insight on the identification, tracking, mitigation, and resolution technical risks and issues to ensure the timely, functionally efficient, and cost effective stand-up of new capabilities&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Identify project key decision points and provide Go/No-Go recommendations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Conduct user outreach to communicate enterprise-level architecture changes, operational concepts, and project status, and accept user inputs for optimization of delivery plans&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Produce weekly activity reports for use by government customers and the program&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ability to develop and present effective technical presentations to senior management and to technical/non-technical audiences;
