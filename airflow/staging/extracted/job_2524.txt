We develop software that has a variety of end users: mobile apps and websites that help our customers manage their money, desktop software that allows our customer service agents to provide help and advice, and internal databases, microservices or tools that teams at Citi rely upon every day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our Data &amp;amp; Analytics team makes all of that possible, whether it\u2019s getting data from Point A to B securely and efficiently; creating customized visualization tools for evaluating performance or forecasting outcomes; building and maintaining our Big Data pipelines; or scaling our data science models to production.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No matter which team you\u2019re part of here, you\u2019ll be solving complex challenges alongside great people.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your Role&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;You\u2019d be placed into our Data &amp;amp; Analytics organization into one of the following roles (experience with one or more of the listed technologies is required):&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Data Engineer: Hadoop/Big Data Technologies, Spark, Google or AWS Cloud Development Data Solutions, Scala, Python, SQL.

Job offers are made with a specific role in mind, so you would know your specific position well in advance of joining the company.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Training&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Soon after joining, you\u2019ll go through several weeks of training to better understand our applications, team structure and processes.
