We currently design, build and deploy a quadrotor robot that autonomously explores potentially hazardous environments to help service members make informed decisions. For our world-class team, no idea is too ambitious, and we never stop working to make possible what looks out of reach today. We are backed by Silicon Valley venture capital firms including Andreessen Horowitz, have been shipping product since 2018, and are growing rapidly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Job Description &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Help us build world-class infrastructure for training, evaluating and productizing machine learning models! As a member of our machine learning software infrastructure team you will work with colleagues to improve workflows, develop pipelines to train and evaluate advanced machine learning models and ensure these pipelines are efficient and well-tested. At Shield you\u2019ll be part of an elite team that uses machine learning to enable autonomous robots that save lives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt; What You'll Do &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Work with colleagues to design, build and maintain high performance software libraries and pipelines for machine learning. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Work with team members to deliver software features on-time and meeting requirements. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Identify performance bottlenecks and design and implement solutions for them. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Improve visibility into model training and experiment tracking for machine learning engineers. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Document code and workflows to enable engineers to rapidly implement solutions using the pipelines. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maintain a small machine learning model for demonstration, prototyping, and testing. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Help manage our cluster resources. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Learn and apply best practices for state of the art machine learning development. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Projects You Might Work On &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Setup model tracking and metric visualizations using jupyter notebooks, mlflow, tensorboard or other modern tools. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Optimize pipeline implementations to reduce training time and maximize compute resource utilization. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Enable efficient hyperparameter optimization. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Required Qualifications &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bachelors in computer science, software engineering, machine learning engineering or similar field. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You have a demonstrated record of working hard, being a trustworthy teammate, holding yourself and others to high standards, and being kind to others. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Good written and verbal communication skills. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;If you're interested in being part of our team, apply now!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shield AI is proud to be an equal opportunity workplace and is an affirmative action employer.
