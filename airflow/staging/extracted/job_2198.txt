You bring to the table a base understanding of many modern open-source web technologies and are dedicated to learning more. Each day you will be collaborating with Tech Leads, Product Managers, UX Designers, and other talented Engineers to deliver great solutions on an exponentially growing application.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;You'll Be Working On a Platform That Serves&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; Several million engaged users &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; 4.000 Clients across 190 countries, including 25% of Fortune 500 companies &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; 50 billion+ consumer-generated API calls a year &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Our Technology&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Our next generation SAAS platform is using an exciting mixture of technologies: Large scale,\u202fhighly available, public-facing applications built in Angular for web and native Android/iOS for mobile. Our backend is composed of many different micro-services built using Spring Boot Rest APIs and Apache Storm, backed by a combination of technologies to fit our scaling needs like PostgreSQL, Cassandra/ScyllaDB, Kafka, Redis, and Elasticsearch allowing us to process billions of events using an event-based architecture. All of this is hosted on AWS utilizing tools like Terraform and Ansible to manage our infrastructure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At Virgin Pulse we are a big believer in teams owning their features and we have instilled a motto of \u201cbuild, deploy, run\u201d.

To support this, we practice CI/CD, allowing each team to deliver value to our customers in as short amount of time as possible, while also giving our teams a continuous feedback loop by using tools like New Relic, ELK, and CloudWatch to monitor application health and performance. The times of weekly, bi-weekly, or even quarterly releases are a thing of the past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Who You Are&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Responsibilities &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
