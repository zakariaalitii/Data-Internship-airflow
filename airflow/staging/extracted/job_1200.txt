But, we all share one thing in common: we\u2019re passionate about accelerating software innovation. Our vision is to put Nexus products at the center of every open-source decision made by modern engineering organizations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We support our remote employee experience. While we have great office spaces in the Fulton MD, Tyson's Corner VA, London UK, and Sydney AUS, we\u2019re very distributed and remote first (and always have been). We use several communication tools to connect across the company\u2014and all remote employees have the opportunity to visit our offices and meet their teams face-to-face at team meetups. We also have an annual company meetup to get quality in-person time with the entire company at least once a year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn more at www.sonatype.com .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are looking for team members who want to help us change how the world innovates through software.

That was just the beginning. We need your help so that we can do it again. If you are interested in delivering value across nearly every decision made in the world of software development to help companies create better and safer software faster, to transform innovation through software, read on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Who You Are And What You'll Do&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;You are an experienced data scientist ready to define and solve questions at the edge of our existing business model and to help us further innovate in our work for the enterprise and open-source communities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You will work collaboratively with data engineers and data analysts on the RNA team to build short-term prototypes and proof of concepts for our long-term vision. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You are business intelligence-oriented and are interested in customer statistics, product popularity, segmentation, etc. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You will build ML/AI models to prove or disprove hypotheses quickly. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You will work with large data sets to provide insight into timely business-critical questions. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You will be a storyteller for data science, helping the team and users on the journey to understanding our data.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What Skills You'll Need&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;You have a BS, MS, or Ph.D. in Data Science, Computer Science, Statistics, or equivalent experience.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You have 3+ years of work experience in data science or a related field.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You have experience working with data lakes and data warehouses and working in a notebook environment (e.g., Databricks, Jupyter Notebook).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You have experience with at least one commonly used data science programming language (e.g., Python, Scala, SQL).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You have experience with multiple machine learning packages, platforms, and tools (e.g., pandas, scikit, numpy, Spark).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You have experience working with data visualization tools (e.g., d3, plotly).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Also, we know it\u2019s tough, but please try to avoid the confidence gap .
