The Data Scientist will be working with a cross functional team whose objective is to create machine learning algorithms and interfaces that enhance the ability of lab personnel to predict formulations based on historical data and customer preferences (structure property relationships). Initially, the scientist will be working with a group of other R&amp;amp;D scientists to identify new descriptors for polyols, isocyanates, and formulated systems that could be used to improve the accuracy of polyurethane (PU) predictive models. Future projects could include deployment of new tool and development of advanced models in new chemistry and material domains.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are seeking candidates who have expertise in one or more of the following areas: chemical engineering, materials science, chemistry, polymer science, theoretical modeling, mechanical engineering as well as data science and programming experience. The individual will work with project teams to solve chemical- and material-related problems through both fundamental and applied research. The types of projects span from product research to process research to application development. Examples include new molecule or material synthesis, process scale-up, reaction engineering and study and application of structure-property relationships to new product development. The specific opportunities including project type, geography and timing are variable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Traits&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Familiar with polymer properties&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;An exposure to the safety culture of an industrial company and its implications.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with machine learning, its applicability to industry, and potential for value creation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Managing confidential information and property (access to systems) properly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Able to work independently but also in teams&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Effective communicator&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ability to quickly assimilate and understand new technology&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Agile and adaptable with an ability to drive results in the face of ambiguity&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Excellent time-management skills and ability to work under tight deadlines&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Effective stakeholder management, relationship building, and trust building&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strong negotiations skills with the ability to resolve conflict&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Organized and detailed&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Required Qualifications&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bachelor's degree in Chemistry, Chemical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Materials Science, Polymer Science or other related disciplines.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Minimum 2 years of experience in data analytics, modelling, or machine learning&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preferred Qualifications&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;PhD in Chemistry, Chemical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Material Science, Polymer Science or other related disciplines.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Proficient in python, and developing regression- and classification-based machine learning models using Scikit-learn and Tensorflow/Pytorch&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience with cheminformatics tools such as RDKit, DeepChem to generate numerical representation (fingerprints/descriptors) of molecules&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Knowledge about AWS , Azure AutoML, Manage DevOps based pipelines&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience in SQL, Pandas, Jupyter-notebook, and Git&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Domestic relocation assistance is available for this role and may be provided based on eligibility.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dow Offers:&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A robust total rewards program, including: competitive base pay, variable pay that rewards individual, team, and Company performance, and comprehensive benefits&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On-going learning opportunities within a diverse, inclusive and rewarding work environment &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Career experiences that can span different Dow businesses and functions with opportunities for personal and professional growth &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The chance to work within a global company and interact with colleagues from around the world &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Opportunities that spark your imagination and ignite your passion to help others &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About Dow&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Dow (NYSE: DOW) combines global breadth, asset integration and scale, focused innovation and leading business positions to achieve profitable growth.
