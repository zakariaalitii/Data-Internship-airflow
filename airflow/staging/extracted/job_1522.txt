And we are the team solving this problem every single day for millions of patients across the country.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Covera Health is transforming how quality health care is measured and delivered. We are starting in radiology where the wrong diagnosis can lead to a cascade effect of misguided care, enormous patient harm and, for some, a missed opportunity for recovery. An early and accurate diagnosis is the patient's best chance to get better.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our first product uses a proprietary framework that leverages advanced data science and artificial intelligence to help patients receive an accurate diagnosis. Today, we are working with some of the largest healthcare payers in the country to impact millions of patient lives. With a pipeline representing 25% of insured individuals in the US, the opportunity to transform radiology and, in turn, improve patient care across the globe is in front of us.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Headquartered in New York City, Covera Health closed a $23.5M Series B financing round with Insight Partners, a leading global venture capital and private equity firm investing in high-growth companies that are driving transformative change in their industries.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About The Role&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;As a software engineer at Covera Health, you'll gain a deep understanding of our product through close collaboration with data scientists, clinicians, and others in the company.
