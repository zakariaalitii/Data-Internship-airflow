At Near, we believe that great culture is not just about work; it\u2019s work + life. We not only encourage our employees to dream big, but also give them the freedom and the tools to do so.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Machine Learning Engineer role is a new, remote-friendly role on the Data Science team, allowing the department to develop solutions that are more scalable at a faster pace. You won\u2019t be just an implementer of solutions, but a full-fledged part of developing those solutions. Our Data Science team is a highly collaborative group that works closely with other Product, Engineering, and Analytics Teams to develop novel algorithmic approaches for contextualizing location data, evaluation of data from potential business partners, as well as managing data optimization from advertising data sources, and analysis of bidding data from mobile app monetization. We are the champions and guardians of Near\u2019s data. Ours is often greenfield work - we work on the problems no one knows how to solve yet. You will be writing code for machine learning and big-data processing solutions being developed by our team as well as being a resource to help our Data Scientists write more scalable, more maintainable, more performant code themselves using better processes like code reviews. You\u2019ll also be a translator of \u2018Data Scientist\u2019 speak to \u2018Engineer\u2019 speak and help bridge the gap between the two teams. Near is a high-speed operation \u2013 all good startups are \u2013 and you shouldn\u2019t expect to take a project and disappear for weeks or months.
