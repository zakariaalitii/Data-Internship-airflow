The received signals are commonly one hundred times weaker than cosmic microwave background radiation left over from the Big Bang and arrive next to interfering signals ten billion times stronger, just few MHz away.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our GNSS team is part of Apple's wireless SOC team. We are a vertically integrated engineering team spanning RF, mixed signal analog design, systems engineering, Design Verification, RTL design, firmware and software engineering, Test, and Validation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our focus is on highly energy efficient and robust GNSS receiver design. We develop GNSS technology that touches hundreds of millions of lives, something we are passionate about. We\u2019d like you to consider being a part of our team. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a GNSS RF System Debug Engineer, you will be a key member of Apple\u2019s cellular team, driving cellular development for our next generation wireless products used by millions.
