{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "JobPosting", "datePosted": "2021-08-10T00:00:00.000Z", "description": "&lt;strong&gt;Los Angeles, CA &lt;em&gt;(Preference for Los Angeles, open to remote)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Who We Are&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;At sweetgreen, a Software Engineer is responsible for building, testing, debugging/troubleshooting, and maintaining code for both web and native applications. They share some infrastructure responsibilities regarding DevOps, take the lead on continuous integration and deployment, and drive standards with Lead Engineers and the rest of the department.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is expected that an Engineer will promote strong design principles as they relate to scalability, disposable resources, automation, loose coupling, service oriented design, databases, removing single points of failure, cache, cost, and security. They are trusted squad members that heavily influence the design and implementation of new services while also integrating with and upgrading existing ones to address mission-critical problems. Working closely with Senior Engineers, Software Engineering Managers and Principals, they champion architectural decisions that facilitate the work of their teams and our business as a whole.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Success depends on balancing their schedules to implement their designs alongside their peers as hands-on senior contributors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Top Goal - &lt;/strong&gt; Within 90 days, be actively contributing to the development of a complete in-house system for the Customer Relationship Platform (CRP) system. The approach needs to be implemented in a sequence of logical steps addressing major business problems as part of the process: scalability, compatibility, and incrementality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your Impact &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Map the Existing System: A guest order flows through many systems before making it to our customers. In your first two weeks, you\u2019ll have developed a deep understanding of the order lifecycle by reviewing the existing system design and documentation. By day 21, you will have contributed to those areas that need additional documentation, in both Confluence and elsewhere.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Collaboratively Design and Evaluate Alternatives: Within 30 days, conduct a high-level end-to-end system analysis. Work with Product to understand the user needs and the CRP engineering squad to develop realistic solutions. Develop against technical design documents (TDDs) that describe our solutions and work with other Lead Engineers and Software Engineering Managers to conduct trade-off analysis with a specific focus on scalability and sustainability. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Present Your Solution: By 45 days in seat, you will be contributing to and influencing TDDs in support of our Lead Engineers and Software Engineering Managers - providing feedback for feasibility, scalability, and implications for how our solutions would interface with existing systems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lead the Technical Implementation: By day 90, you will spend 75%+ of your time conducting the technical development of the solutions with our team of engineers and personally building RESTful APIs for your solution. The primary focus of the technical development effort will be to assume ownership over the custom-developed portions of the Store + Operations platform. Your work will include presenting your own pull requests and reviewing others. In partnership with Product and Technical Program Management you\u2019ll hold yourself accountable to the dates that you committed to, completing feature work in your first sprint. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Documentation: In order to ease future teammate onboarding, debugging, and knowledge sharing of complex services while mitigating the risk of tribal knowledge, within 30 days in seat, you\u2019ll contribute to our established information architecture within Confluence and put a plan in place to realize 100% documentation of the systems you own.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Monitoring System Health: By day 90, you will be contributing to the implementation of missing or leverage existing telemetry and testing, through CI/CD, so you can report on the health of your services, triage bugs, and limit regression.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Raise The Bar: At sweetgreen we dedicate a portion of our attention to matters that may not be immediately customer facing and instead allow for us to work smarter, or faster, or simply reduce friction in the developer experience. You\u2019ll own your squad\u2019s specific backlog that is focused on operational excellence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your Accomplishments &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Demonstrated track record of building exceptional software &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Extensive experience and knowledge with Javascript, Nest.js, or React&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Knowledge and experience with AGILE methodology.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience consuming RESTful APIs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience deploying website A/B testing or personalization&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strong understanding of best practices relating to frontend architecture&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A strong desire to experiment with bleeding edge technology and understand relating market trends.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strong problem solving, communication, and creative skills.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strong time management.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What You'll Get&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Three different medical plans to suit your and your family's needs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dental and Vision insurance&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Flexible PTO plan&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;401k; company match of 50% up to 3% of employee contribution&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;5 months paid family leave; we believe in fully supporting new parents&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Employee HSA and FSA&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Complimentary greens&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;An opportunity to make a real impact on the people around you, both by growing them and by connecting them to real food&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To live the sweetlife and celebrate your passion + purpose&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A collaborative team of people who live our core values and have your back&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A clear career path with opportunities for development, both personally and professionally&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Free sweetgreen swag&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come join the sweetlife!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About Sweetgreen&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;sweetgreen is on a mission to build healthier communities by connecting people to real food.
