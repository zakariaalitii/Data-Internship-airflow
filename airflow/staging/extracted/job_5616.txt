We do this through openness, accountability, careful policy enforcement, and respect for people\u2019s personal freedoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our platform fuses disconnected, unstructured data across secure networks and empowers users with highly intuitive interfaces to search, analyze, and collaborate. Customers tell us we help them solve cases that they thought were unsolvable, and allow them to communicate in ways they have never seen before. We are particularly proud to help government agencies solve more crimes while averting wrongful arrests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peregrine has been used to protect children and victims of human trafficking, diffuse organized crime networks, de-escalate hostage scenarios, solve homicide cases, identify serial burglary suspects, and more. Customers use the same platform to facilitate Freedom of Information responses, provide targeted social services for homeless populations, and share data with their community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We believe the careful deployment of modern technology to solve hard problems in government will create extraordinary positive change for our society, and we seek teammates who want to be part of our mission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHY US&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peregrine is set up to build better governance and communities.
