Every year, 500,000 families in the United States declare bankruptcy due to large medical bills. People should not have their lives destroyed because they can\u2019t afford something they require to survive. At Walnut, we\u2019re on a mission to change this number from 500,000 bankruptcies per year to 0.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walnut is a fintech company that expands financial access to healthcare. We\u2019re building a point-of-sale embedded lending platform that makes healthcare more affordable for patients by breaking up large medical bills into small, monthly payments. This helps patients actually afford healthcare and helps healthcare providers capture more revenue and increase collections. We\u2019re backed by prominent investors including Gradient Ventures (Google\u2019s AI-focused venture fund), Plaid, Afore Capital, 2048 Ventures, Newark Venture Partners, Supernode Ventures, and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\u270d\ufe0f About the Role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overview&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As our first Software Engineer, you will be an integral member of a small, fast-paced engineering team building our core product and scaling it as the company grows.
