It leverages the power of Facebook and Instagram reach and WhatsApp\u2019s core functionality of delightful and private messaging. It allows businesses to target users in Facebook, Instagram and other properties across Facebook, Inc. and enable the businesses to open WhatsApp threads and start interacting with users over WhatsApp. For example: A business which sells apparel, uses CTWA ads to open threads with customers where they sell the product, provide discount and accept payments from customers. The product (CTWA ads) is being used by millions of small businesses (many without websites) to support and scale their businesses, particularly important during the current pandemic. The product is in a sweet spot, where it has already proven strong product market fit and generating meaningful revenue.
