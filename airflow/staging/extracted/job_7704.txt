That\u2019s our focus at JPL. We ask the biggest questions, then search the universe for answers\u2014literally. We build upon ideas that have guided generations, then share our discoveries to inspire generations to come. Your mission\u2014your opportunity\u2014is to seek out the answers that bring us one step closer. If you\u2019re driven to discover, create, and inspire something that lasts a lifetime and beyond, you\u2019re ready for JPL.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Located in Pasadena, California, JPL has a campus-like environment situated on 177 acres in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains and offers a work environment unlike any other: we inspire passion, foster innovation, build collaboration, and reward excellence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Responsibilities&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Our missions are complex, long-lasting, far-reaching\u2014and each one is unique. We\u2019re constantly developing new mission-specific software. For designers, engineers, architects, and developers who like to test the limits, JPL is a constant source of new stimulating challenges.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this role you would be a vital team member in a JPL software or computer engineering groups. You will partner with lead engineers to design, code, and develop secure software applications and interface solutions that power JPL\u2019s spacecraft, science instruments, mission control systems, science analysis pipelines and IT services. You will integrate algorithms and models into software components for production and analysis of mission and enterprise data. You will use general understanding of the complexity and interdependence involved with integrating multiple applications with complex data sources, and deploying the resulting systems at sites worldwide and beyond.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Opportunities in Software Computing Systems Engineering include, but are not limited to, the following:&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cybersecurity Engineer&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Data Scientist&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Data Visualization Developer&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Electrical Ground Support Equipment Software Engineer&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Engineering Applications Software Engineer&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Flight Software Engineer&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Scientific Application &amp;amp; Data Interaction Engineer&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Scientific Applications Software Engineer&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Software Systems Architect&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Software Systems Engineer&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Software Systems Engineer&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;User Interface Designer&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;User Interface Developer&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Qualifications&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bachelor's with at least one year related work experience, Master's, or PhD degree in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Software Engineering, or a related majors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Minimum of a 3.0/4.0 cumulative GPA.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Recently completed coursework providing an understanding and application of standard principles, theories, concepts and techniques in Software or related.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;General knowledge of applicable industry and/or academic practices and standards in related to Software or related.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strong written and verbal communication skills and ability to work in a team environment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prior internship/volunteer experience in related disciplines.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Participation in student/volunteer organizations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strong analytical skills.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;JPL is an Equal Opportunity Employer.
