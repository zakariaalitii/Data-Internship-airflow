We\u2019re a team of Product Managers and Applied Data Scientists who build apps, love data, and talk code - join us! We\u2019re looking for creative problem-solvers who can help us identify growth opportunities and unmet customer needs through customer research, data analysis and experimentation. We move quickly - yes, even at Microsoft! - so you\u2019ll help us push beyond \u2018but we\u2019ve always done it that way\u2019 and \u2018is that allowed?\u2019 to ensure we can get the insights we need to build the best products.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It doesn\u2019t matter what your previous job titles have been - we expect that you\u2019re comfortable with market analysis, data analysis, experimentation, talking to customers, partnering with internal teams to get things done, tackling ambiguous questions, and learning new skills. You\u2019ll need the humility to be okay with ideas and projects that don\u2019t panout, andbe able to learn from them. You\u2019ll have the support of your team and active sponsorship from our executive team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You will be working on growing products made in our Developer Division that are used by millions of developers worldwide. According to the 2021 Stack Overflow developer survey, Visual Studio Code is used by more than 70% of developers, with Azure being used by more than 30%. We\u2019re constantly striving to learn the needs of developers, how they work and what frustrates them, and how we can help them be more productive. Delighting and retaining developers who use Azure with our tools and services is our core mission.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Responsibilities&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Here\u2019s what you\u2019ll do and learn to be successful in this role:&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;You\u2019ll need to understand market trends and growth opportunities and what our customers and competitors are doing in response to those. We use a variety of quantitative and qualitative approaches - and welcome your input on other creative methods. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You\u2019ll help us make sense of the telemetry signals from our developer tools and services. Are there patterns of usage that lead to churn or retention, for example? Data synthesis and story telling are a core part of the role. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You\u2019ll propose product strategies and marketing efforts to capitalize on growth opportunities, and collaborate with teams in the Developer Division and Azure to test out and execute on those strategies. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You\u2019ll design and execute controlled experiments to address product problems we find. Not every idea works. You will help us understand when the data tells us we need to pivot or revisit our approach altogether. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You will help those teams understand how their tools and services contribute to the end-to-end developer experience, and you will collaborate with them to test ideas for improving the developer workflow. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You\u2019ll be an active learner and problem-solver, eager to work alongside data scientists, engineers, and designers to get things done. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You\u2019ll be seeking meaning in the data, curious and comfortable exploring large data sets to find clues about growth opportunities and product insights. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;We work hard together through the work day, and we value having time for family or hobbies in the evenings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Qualifications&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Required Qualifications:&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2+ years working in a technical field (engineer, data analyst, data scientist, product manager, growth-hacking, or equivalent) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1+ years of industry experience performing product analytics or data science &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1+ years of industry experience as a Program Manager/Product Manager or driving cross-functional team projects &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Preferred Qualifications&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bachelor\u2019s degree in Computer Science, Math, Engineering, Science or similar experience &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Proficient in SQL and data analysis tools (Python, R, etc) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience running controlled experiments &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience defining and measuring adoption funnels &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Obsess over customer experience &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make recommendations based on data &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience creating product visions &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience synthesizing customer research data &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Value diversity and inclusivity in the workplace &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Requirements&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;These requirements include, but are not limited to the following specialized security screenings&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ability to meet Microsoft, customer and/or government security screening requirements are required for this role.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Microsoft Cloud Background Check: This position will be required to pass the Microsoft Cloud background check upon hire/transfer and every two years thereafter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Microsoft is an equal opportunity employer.
