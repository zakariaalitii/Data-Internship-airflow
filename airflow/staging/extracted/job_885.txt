You know the best software is created through collaboration and iteration and you\u2019re looking for the right opportunity, and the right team, to expand your experience. You seek feedback because it has the ability to turn good work into great work. You like to ship software early and often, you value simplicity and strive to eliminate unnecessary complexity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ClassPass is looking for engineers with a ML background who are excited to develop their software engineering skills.
