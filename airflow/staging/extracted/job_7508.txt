These are the people who power Search for the App Store, Apple TV, Apple Music, Apple Podcasts, and Apple Books. And they do it on a massive scale, meeting Apple\u2019s high expectations with high performance to deliver a huge variety of entertainment in over 35 languages to more than 150 countries. These engineers build secure, end-to-end solutions. They develop the custom software used to process all the creative work, the tools that providers use to deliver that media, all the server-side systems, and the APIs for many Apple services. Thanks to Apple\u2019s unique integration of hardware, software, and services, engineers here partner to get behind a single unified vision. That vision always includes a deep commitment to strengthening Apple\u2019s privacy policy, one of Apple\u2019s core values. Although services are a bigger part of Apple\u2019s business than ever before, these teams remain small, nimble, and cross-functional, offering greater exposure to the array of opportunities here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Qualifications&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;Deep understanding of the search and information retrieval fundamentals including indexing, query understanding, retrieval and ranking&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Strong Industrial experience with one or more of the following: search, classification, regression, recommendation systems, targeting systems, ranking systems, fraud detection, online advertising, or related&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;10+ years of relevant industry experience&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Experience with Learning to Rank algorithms&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Experience building big data pipelines with Hadoop, Java, Scala, and Spark&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Familiarity with A/B experimentation and data/metric-driven product development&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Passion. Our customers love what we do at Apple and we want the same from our engineers&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;We\u2019re a diverse collective of thinkers and doers, continually reimagining what\u2019s possible to help us all find what we love in new ways.
