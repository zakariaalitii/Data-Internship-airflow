Today the world sends more than $155 trillion across borders. Yet, the underlying infrastructure is dated and flawed. Ripple connects banks, payment providers, corporates and digital asset exchanges via RippleNet to provide one frictionless experience to send money globally.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Staff Software Engineer will help lead the design of the next generation of payment applications that enable banks to instantly settle cross-border payments to create the Internet of Value. Ripple\u2019s distributed financial technology outperforms today\u2019s banking infrastructure by driving down costs, increasing processing speeds and delivering end-to-end visibility into payment fees, timing and delivery. As Ripple\u2019s customer base grows globally, the Staff Engineer will help drive the move to a highly available cloud deployment, processing fast and resilient payments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What You\u2019ll Do&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Build enterprise, distributed payment applications that execute settlement within seconds to enable the Internet of Value&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prototype new solutions for complex software problems and implement them for on premise and cloud deployments and use cases&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Debug production issues across services and multiple levels of the stack&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Work with teams across the organization, including product, legal, and business development to think beyond the technical implications of your design decisions&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What We\u2019re Looking For&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interest in either software development, data analysis or technical operations in working with blockchain, payments and production systems&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bachelor\u2019s degree or higher in Software Engineering, Computer Science, or a related field (or equivalent)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;0-2 years of hands-on Software Development experience with experience in the following areas: Java, Python, C++, Javascript, Spring, Relational Databases, Kubernetes, AWS&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bonus: Experience in building transactional systems (preferably in payments / banking / e-commerce domains) , backed by an RDBMS (PostgreSQL, Oracle or MS SQL Server)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience building highly scalable and performant enterprise software&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Intellectual curiosity - you love to dig into how things work and understand how to improve and scale them&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You thrive on autonomy, responsibility and owning your work, end to end&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A positive attitude and a passion for sharing knowledge within your team and organization&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ability to encourage and drive engineering best practices&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be a recent graduate of Spring 2020, Fall 2020, Spring 2021&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;em&gt;Learn more about engineering at Ripple by visiting our blog, \u201c&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Get Technical.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Who We Are&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Ripple enables payments everywhere, every way, for everyone using the power of blockchain and crypto.
