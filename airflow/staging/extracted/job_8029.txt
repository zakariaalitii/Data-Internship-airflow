We provide a truly full-stack (hardware + firmware + software) solution for real-time monitoring of America's power distribution grid. The system centers around low-cost hardware platforms that are easily and permanently deployed to power poles. The platform detects and predicts faults that ignite wildfires, expedites repairs during power outages, and helps utilities demonstrate risk reduction to regulators through comprehensive asset health profiles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gridware\u2019s technology is designed to unlock essential values for other adjacent verticals. Our unique positioning allows us to solve some of the world\u2019s most burning challenges -- from helping policy makers make data-driven infrastructure decisions to helping farmers overcome micro-climate challenges. While others turn a blind eye to these aged and highly-regulated industries, we at Gridware believe it\u2019s our duty to find win-for-all scenarios that lead to a prosperous future for coming generations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gridware is a privately-held company with funding from major investors such as Y Combinator, True Ventures, and Fifty Years, as well as the California Energy Commission.
