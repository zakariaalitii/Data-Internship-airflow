The Covid-19 crisis presents an opportunity for Microsoft to participate in a dramatic shift with regards to how both society and the medical community view the delivery of health care. COVID-19 has shifted the standard office visit into the home, advancing the demand for virtual care and accelerating a long-forecasted trend for a new healthcare segment in home healthcare.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This emergence will democratize the delivery care, enabling more virtual care services such as remote monitoring into the home. As a result, the notion of in-home care services (also referred to as Connected Care) will become an increasingly used and vital mechanism for everyone on the planet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\u202f&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The company and team:&lt;/strong&gt; At Microsoft, we have a clear mission and bold ambitions: Empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more through our technology and innovation.
