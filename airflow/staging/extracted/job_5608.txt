We\u2019re dedicated to empowering this transformation by building the tools and experiences that thousands of developers use to create their own products. Plaid powers the tools millions of people rely on to live a healthier financial life. We work with thousands of companies like Venmo and SoFi, several of the Fortune 500, and many of the largest banks to make it easy for people to connect their financial accounts to the apps and services they want to use. Plaid\u2019s network covers 11,000 financial institutions across the US, Canada, UK and Europe. Founded in 2013, the company is headquartered in San Francisco with offices in New York, Salt Lake City, Washington D.C., London and Amsterdam.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We believe that the way consumers and businesses interact with their finances will drastically improve in the next few years. Plaid's goal is to enable this shift by building the tools and infrastructure that allow developers to create the next generation of financial services applications. As a software engineer at Plaid, you'll be an integral part of building and scaling the APIs that help us all achieve this vision.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We\u2019re architected around decoupled services. You could be working on our internal distributed systems framework that holds them all together, or building out the newest version of our API. Most of our back-end core systems are written in Go, but that's not a prerequisite. We pick the right tool for the job and have systems in Go, TypeScript, and Python.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What Excites Us&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Degree in engineering, CS, physics, math, statistics, or another related field&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strong track record of building interesting projects, whether during internships, for school, or independently&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great fundamentals and a strong command of at least one language&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Product mindset. You understand that building the right tools and systems can impact millions of users&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Adaptability. Most of our engineers work across the entire stack, touching everything from the front end to our core infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Internship experience writing software for a startup or large tech company is a plus&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company.
