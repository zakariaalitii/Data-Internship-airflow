Our platform enables organizations to license their providers in new states, verify existing credentials, and get in-network with insurance payers. In less than a year, we\u2019ve launched our platform, built an all-star team, powered dozens of great companies, and served thousands of healthcare providers across the industry!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The heart of Medallion\u2019s success lies in bringing modern technology and automation to the archaic world of healthcare administration. Our web platform and API provide a robust (and, dare we say, delightful!) abstraction over hundreds of healthcare systems, processes, and protocols from medical and insurance bodies across the US. This abstraction is brought to life by a suite of data integrations, web crawlers, and backend intelligence that turns crucial but complicated, manual processes into automated, turn-key solutions, critical to the growth of our customers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Medallion is built by a small, distributed team of seasoned product-minded engineers with decades of experience across startups and public companies alike. We pride ourselves on our level of product ownership (we don\u2019t have a PM yet!); respect and trust for each other; and an ability to execute extremely fast on new ideas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We've raised $20M from some of the best investors like Spark Capital, Optum Ventures, Elad Gil, Peter Reinhardt, and many others.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Collaborate with other engineers to build core infrastructure and features (develop web apps, write backend services, organize data stores, orchestrate cloud tools, and more).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Work with internal and external stakeholders to discover and design new product features&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Participate in (and influence) sprint planning, roadmap development, and other team processes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Help build an awesome company :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Requirements&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2+ years of experience working on software teams&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Proficiency with a general-purpose backend language \u2013 Python, Go, Ruby, Java, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Comfort with backend systems \u2013 web applications, databases, cloud infrastructure, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Comfort with Javascript (or an appetite to learn)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A desire for ownership, impact, and growth&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "Medallion", "sameAs": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/medallion-credentials", "logo": "https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C560BAQHK6uSZUBC6NA/company-logo_200_200/0/1622761986205?e=1639008000&amp;v=beta&amp;t=Mga9ybcGGjvLgQ7irLVzk-4gDGUJTKGY0ZHauC4_SdM"}, "identifier": {"@type": "PropertyValue", "name": "Medallion", "value": "4068808004"}, "image": "https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C560BAQHK6uSZUBC6NA/company-logo_100_100/0/1622761986205?e=1639008000&amp;v=beta&amp;t=dp9tAQdji4nOr5rUkhwBdE-Sey6kgxUpRqLT4GhMVNU", "industry": "Internet,Computer Software,Health, Wellness and Fitness", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "US", "addressLocality": "United States", "addressRegion": null, "postalCode": "99999", "streetAddress": null}, "latitude": 39.50355, "longitude": -99.0183}, "skills": "", "title": "Software Engineer", "validThrough": "2021-10-02T15:30:00.000Z", "educationRequirements": {"@type": "EducationalOccupationalCredential", "credentialCategory": "bachelor degree"}, "experienceRequirements": {"@type": "OccupationalExperienceRequirements", "monthsOfExperience": 24}, "jobLocationType": "TELECOMMUTE", "applicantLocationRequirements": {"@type": "Country", "name": "United States"}}
