Hunter\u2019s award-winning research and development team of engineers is responsible for hundreds of patented and exclusive features on our equipment. We are in search of a student studying Computer Science or Computer Engineering interested in Data Science.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Job Summary&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;This position is primarily responsible for the research and development of various features based on Machine Learning. Students work primarily on a Windows PC with Python. Much of the actual machine learning training is done on a Linux machine. There is a lot of real world data from Hunter equipment making this a unique Data Science job.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Responsibilities&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The individual will be involved in a variety of projects which may include:&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; Test and evaluate machine learning models &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Data annotation and manipulation &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Create and use PowerShell and Python scripts to acquire and organize data. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Create and use VBA scripts in Excel as part of data evaluation. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Create and use Python programs to clean and evaluate data. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Work with source control tools like Microsoft TFS and GIT to save and control data. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Annotate data used for training an ML model. An example annotation program would be the use of Microsoft VoTT to identify and tag objects in images. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Document frequently used processes such that someone else might be able to complete related tasks. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Update training, test, and validation data used for a specific ML model as the data changes. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Work with an AI platform like TensorFlow or PyTorch. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Configure and use a Linux PC to shorten ML model training times. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Experiment with ML models and data to improve final results. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Software design and testing &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What To Expect&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Qualifications &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;It will be our intent and purpose to provide the individual with real world experience, which includes assisting in the progression of a product from concept stage to production. The work done by co-ops in this position is applied to actual Hunter products. The work is normally very individualized even if you are working in a larger group. We host many co-ops annually. Our goal is to provide an experience that will be an important, effective first step in the career of a future engineer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also visit our website for testimonials from previous co-ops&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;https://www.hunter.com/about-us/careers/co-op/&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Qualifications&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; Minimum 3.0 GPA (must be on resume) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Major study in Computer Science or Computer Engineering &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; At least some programming experience &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Excellent communication skills.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;", "employmentType": "INTERN", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "Hunter Engineering Company", "sameAs": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/hunter-engineering", "logo": "https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E0BAQGO_U2HbN_AKA/company-logo_200_200/0/1522243744809?e=1638403200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=gViuViEqrRRVqkTuXnduir726q3MP7z8h86d0yZAbYU"}, "identifier": {"@type": "PropertyValue", "name": "Hunter Engineering Company", "value": "3168"}, "image": "https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E0BAQGO_U2HbN_AKA/company-logo_100_100/0/1522243744809?e=1638403200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=HX6-_kRGIpUWuq9rXvrm0hSWAJp570otRCmdwEzZZUA", "industry": "Information Technology and Services,Computer Software,Automotive", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "US", "addressLocality": "Bridgeton", "addressRegion": "MO", "postalCode": "63044", "streetAddress": null}, "latitude": 38.755707, "longitude": -90.4183}, "skills": "", "title": "Computer Science / Computer Engineer Co-op (Data Science/Machine Vision)", "validThrough": "2021-09-26T05:23:55.000Z", "educationRequirements": {"@type": "EducationalOccupationalCredential", "credentialCategory": "bachelor degree"}}
