Here's a little about us, a little about what we believe, and what we are looking for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Podsights is an industry-leading attribution platform for podcast advertising. We handle over 10 billion events a month and we likely work with some of your favorite brands and publishers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our mission is simple, we are looking to grow the podcast industry. Far too many brands try a podcast advertising campaign and churn. Or worse: they don\u2019t even try to enter the market. By providing a platform for brands to optimize results, we encourage investment in podcast advertising, and by proxy to publishers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The podcasting industry has seen a lot of growth in the past few years, and we believe it has more room to grow. Beyond growth, podcasting presents some interesting problems: its decentralized, RSS-based nature, and the various ways people can listen. Joining Podsights is an excellent opportunity to be hands-on with an evolving medium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We believe that where you went to school has little bearing on your performance as a software engineer. Where you live isn\u2019t a proxy for talent (we're fully remote and the team lives all over the place-- one of us even lives in Spain)! Your current employer provides a low signal about your future potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Different backgrounds bring different perspectives, and we believe this helps us be better problem solvers. We encourage applications from all sorts of diverse backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Podsights, we look for ambition and curiosity. We love engineers that aren\u2019t solely interested in the craft of developing software. Want to start a company of your own one day? If yes, we want to talk. Are you interested in the business side of software? Tell us more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We want curious engineers. You take things apart and see how they work (the real test is if you can put them together too!).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our team consists of members of Embedly (acquired by Medium), Horizon Media, Claritas, NPM, and How Stuff Works. You can learn more about us here:&amp;nbsp;https://podsights.com/team&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've got benefits too:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Competitive compensation and a 401K program&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fully remote role with an annual WFH stipend&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We cover 100% of health benefits (medical, dental, and vision)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We offer 4 weeks of PTO each year&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A generous maternity/paternity leave policy&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your role will focus on our Django application with some projects dipping into the data or the front end. On a given day, you might be creating new data models, adding an endpoint to our API, or working with our data pipelines. The benefit of joining a small team is you will have a tremendous impact on the company's direction and, to some extent, the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Requirements&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2+ years of experience as a backend or data engineer&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Proficiency with Python or a similar language&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with SQL and NoSQL data structures&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Django, Flask, or a similar web framework&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bonus&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Django ORM&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;GraphQL (Graphene)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cloud infrastructure (GCP preferred)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Data and ETL platforms (Airflow, Dataflow, and BigQuery preferred)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If the above interests you, drop us a note. We\u2019re less worried about a resume (LinkedIn is fine), but more importantly, tell us about your ideal next role.
