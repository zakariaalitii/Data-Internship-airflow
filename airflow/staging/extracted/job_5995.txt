Most roles will be based out of our Sunnyvale office and balance in-office time with flexibility to support other needs you have in your life. This flexibility could be used to reduce the Bay Area commute burden by working from home a couple days a week, support parent or caregiver needs, or allow space for you to do the other things you love, whatever that might be! There are times when achieving great work is more productive when working where you work best. That's the point of this model...flexibility for you. A few roles will be approved as fully remote. Those are determined by managers and approved by our senior team.", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "Blue River Technology", "sameAs": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/bluerivertech", "logo": "https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C560BAQFB1G16_b_OOQ/company-logo_200_200/0/1625176220360?e=1637798400&amp;v=beta&amp;t=B8DZVltCilgY9nIC1V27X0srCRILz6oFmU2pahPMQgE"}, "identifier": {"@type": "PropertyValue", "name": "Blue River Technology", "value": "3404193"}, "image": "https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C560BAQFB1G16_b_OOQ/company-logo_100_100/0/1625176220360?e=1637798400&amp;v=beta&amp;t=wCwYAGKxasb2bgekH8eSjG3rpe_C3Q7ol-x-2Hv1u8I", "industry": "Electrical/Electronic Manufacturing,Computer Software,Mechanical or Industrial Engineering", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "US", "addressLocality": "Sunnyvale", "addressRegion": "CA", "postalCode": "94089", "streetAddress": null}, "latitude": 37.373676, "longitude": -122.036575}, "skills": "", "title": "Machine Learning Engineer", "validThrough": "2021-09-23T17:06:44.000Z", "educationRequirements": {"@type": "EducationalOccupationalCredential", "credentialCategory": "bachelor degree"}, "experienceRequirements": {"@type": "OccupationalExperienceRequirements", "monthsOfExperience": 60}, "estimatedSalary": {"@type": "MonetaryAmount", "currency": "USD", "value": {"@type": "QuantitativeValue", "minValue": 104000, "maxValue": 176000, "unitText": "YEAR"}}}
