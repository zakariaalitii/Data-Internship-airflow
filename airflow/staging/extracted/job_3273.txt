Right now, we are looking for a Data Scientist to join our team in Austin, TX*.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Who are you?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You have a background in applied data science and enjoy the process of both developing models and putting them into production to gain insights from complex data sets. You are a wizard with blending data from varied sources, and bringing to bear cutting-edge algorithms and techniques on that data \u2013 but most importantly, you are able to tell the story of your data analysis to others with a less technical background than your own. Above all, you enjoy meeting the challenge of helping teammates solve their analytics problems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What\u2019s the job?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this position, you will support the customer care team by providing your data science expertise, with a focus on encouraging adoption of both KNIME Analytics Platform and KNIME Server among prospects. You will help develop proof-of-concept solutions for these prospects and contribute to software demonstrations for relevant audiences via calls, webinars, and presentations. You will also test newly developed software features and provide input from the perspective of a data scientist end-user to the development team. This is a public facing role, which requires a friendly and helpful attitude towards users, customers, and co-workers, as well as fluency in English. If you have some experience with KNIME software already, that\u2019s great \u2013 but if you don\u2019t, we\u2019ll help you learn.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Who are we?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are a rapidly growing, young company developing software for performing advanced data science. We are a highly interactive team and very enthusiastic about developing solutions for our users. Our open source KNIME Analytics Platform, developed together with the community, is transforming the data science landscape. It is popular among its very active user community as well as among IT analysts. Our commercial KNIME Server enables enterprises to responsibly integrate advanced analytics into their operations. In this way, KNIME helps organizations nurture new user populations that want to exploit the benefits of data science and advanced analytics while remaining strongly committed to open source.&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Though we are happy to have applicants from further away, we\u2019re not offering relocation benefits for this position.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "KNIME", "sameAs": "https://ch.linkedin.com/company/knime.com", "logo": "https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D0BAQFAs2ajzP6U6w/company-logo_200_200/0/1582795161728?e=1636588800&amp;v=beta&amp;t=aXplKDCl4PkIU7kU_YXRPe_JE1--BIquqalqHKbzk5E"}, "identifier": {"@type": "PropertyValue", "name": "KNIME", "value": "936A9255C7"}, "image": "https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D0BAQFAs2ajzP6U6w/company-logo_100_100/0/1582795161728?e=1636588800&amp;v=beta&amp;t=MaXr6Wg24MQqgmGBZkLo8qwbQ9YDrhwm423wk2dxv_M", "industry": "Information Technology and Services,Computer Software,Internet", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "US", "addressLocality": "Austin", "addressRegion": "TX", "postalCode": "78746", "streetAddress": null}, "latitude": 30.264978, "longitude": -97.7466}, "skills": "", "title": "Data Scientist - Customer Care (Austin, TX)", "validThrough": "2021-09-09T04:06:02.000Z", "educationRequirements": {"@type": "EducationalOccupationalCredential", "credentialCategory": "bachelor degree"}}
