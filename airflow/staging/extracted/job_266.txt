What you'll do...IntroductionWe are looking for a Principal Machine Learning Engineers who want to join our exciting journey ahead. You will be working with a team of industry leading data scientists and engineers across the Walmart ecosystem (Walmart Stores, eCommerce, international, etc). Our team is specialized in emerging technology such as Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Causal Inferences, Anomaly detection, etc. You'll sweep us off our feet if..&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You have been exposed to diverse datasets and gained deep end-to-end experience of AI/ML products and their business use cases. You'll make an impact by.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Being able to work on many different types of problems ranging from product &amp;amp; inventory to finance &amp;amp; legal and apply techniques from statistical analysis to deep learning. What you'll do.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Data Source Identification: Understands the priority order of requirements and service level agreements. Defines and identifies the most suitable sources for required data that is fit for purpose, referring to external sources as required. Performs initial data quality checks on the extracted data.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reviews the deliverables of junior associates and provides guidance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Creates continuous, online model learning along with iterative model enhancements. Develops newer techniques (for example, advanced machine learning algorithms, auto ML) by leveraging the latest trends in machine learning, artificial intelligence to train algorithms to apply models to new data sets. Guides the team on feature engineering, experimentation, and advanced modeling techniques to be used for complex problems with unstructured and multiple data sets (for example, streaming data, raw text data).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Model Deployment &amp;amp; Scaling: Deploys models to production. Continuously logs and tracks model behavior once it is deployed against the defined metrics. Identifies model parameters which may need modifications depending on scale of deployment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Code Development &amp;amp; Testing: Writes code to develop the required solution and application features by determining the appropriate programming language and leveraging business, technical, and data requirements. Creates test cases to review and validate the proposed solution design. Creates proofs of concept. Tests the code using the appropriate testing approach. Deploys software to production servers. Contributes code documentation, maintains playbooks, and provides timely progress updates. What you'll bring.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2-4 years of professional, post grad experience in machine learning engineering from development to deployment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Graduate level statistics background in a corporate setting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Graduate level knowledge in machine learning theories.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Intermediate level skills in Python and SQL. Experience with backend development languages like Java would be excellent.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Intermediate level version control and software development principles. Sharing a GitHub repo with us is one of the best way to show case your skill in this area.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience in advance analytics, large scale and complicated database and comprehensive data wrangling. Strongly Preferred Technical Background&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We are looking for an outstanding Scientist/Engineer with machine learning background.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ph.D. in statistics, computer science and similar area with machine learning related projects/publications is strongly preferred.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience with cloud environments such as AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience with GPU and high-performance computing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Research level experience in Deep learning, computer vision, NLP, Reinforcement learning, Anomaly detection, Graph theory and Information security.
