This is what\u2019s known as the metaverse: a persistent space where anyone can do just about anything they can imagine, from anywhere in the world and on any device. The breadth of opportunities, and the evolving demands of this first-of-its-kind platform, ensure that your avenues for growth are always expanding and flexible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Join us and you\u2019ll usher in a new category of human interaction while solving exceptional challenges that you won\u2019t find anywhere else.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHY DATA SCIENCE &amp;amp; ANALYTICS?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The Data Science &amp;amp; Analytics organization's mission is to increase our speed, frequency and acumen of making decisions at scale by instilling a data-influenced approach to building products. We cover a wide area of the data spectrum including analytical data engineering, product analytics, experimentation, causal inference, statistical modeling and machine learning. Aligned and partnering with product verticals, we use this tool belt to discover new opportunities and unmet use cases, influence and shape the product roadmap and prioritization, build data products and measure the impact on our community of players and developers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHY AVATAR?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The Avatar team is missioned to power limitless player identity, expression and behavior in real-time. As a Data Scientist, you will be a key participant in helping our product and engineering teams shape the future vision of Roblox. You'll partner with data scientists, product managers, engineers and leaders across the company to better understand our players and builders, performing ad hoc analysis, creating dashboards, defining KPIs, applying models and designing A/B experiments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;You Are&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Passionate about data.&lt;/strong&gt; You have the curiosity and self-drive to continuously learn new techniques and tools to extract value from data.
