They analyze data for correlations to identify trends and predictive power, and build, maintain, and deploy predictive models. Data Scientists work with analysts to understand business needs and requirements, and data engineers to implement scalable pipelines for ETL, model training, and scoring. They service both ad-hoc requests as well as core pipeline development. The ideal candidate has a passion for discovering insight hidden in large data sets and working with stakeholders to improve business outcomes. They keep up with the latest technology including the latest versions of spark, new analytical packages, etc. They must have a proven ability to drive business results with their data-based insights and be comfortable working with a wide range of stakeholders and functional teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Core
