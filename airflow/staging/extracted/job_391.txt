The Enterprise Engineering team is the key component making it all possible! We are the core to unlocking all the products, services, and tools being used securely and reliably within corporate resources, communicating with one another, and in collaboration with our AWS customers. We build diverse services, ranging from global identity services to critical datacenter infrastructure to customer-facing software, meeting demands for cutting-edge AWS technology and pioneering and what it means to scale optimally.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over 900K Amazonians and variable staff rely on our products in 35 regions, 472 corporate offices, more than 350 fulfillment centers, and over 900 total Amazon locations including logistics centers and physical retail stores.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are a builder organization and take pride in resilience, and security in our services. We have a broad portfolio that we manage through our guiding principles. When services throughout Amazon need an Amazonian's identity to grant access to resources, they call on our identity and authentication services, which include Amazon NT (ANT), Amazon's LDAP Directory (LDAP), and Amazon Federate. LDAP supports identity and infrastructure needs in 35 regions, contains 22M objects, and handles 1.5B search operations each month.&lt;br&gt;Our collaboration products include a multitude of products such as email, SharePoint, Slack, telecom for inbound/outbound calling and emergency services, and products to facilitate rich in-person and remote meetings. Our Amazon Oncall and paging solutions allow all Amazon builders support their services and quickly respond to incidents. On an annual basis, we deliver 12B emails, schedule over 7M meetings, connect 60M phone calls, manage on-call rotations for more than 17K teams, and deliver 18M pages. Our client patch compliance services (e.g. Amazon Client Management Engine) manage 486K Windows, Linux, Ubuntu, and Mac desktops and laptops, keeping current with patch releases at lightning speed which no other organization in the world can compare to.&lt;br&gt;Enterprise Engineering drives the Unfabric program, leading the way to zero trust networks inside Amazon and enabling Amazonians to access corporate resources with a zero trust model. We built Amazon Enterprise Access (AEA). Today, AEA provides off-CORP access to Amazon services for 42K iOS and Android mobile devices and 486K AEA-ready laptops. Working from home or on devices with secure access to internal programs is become easier and easier and our teams are pioneering this technology!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enterprise Engineering also supports workloads central to the operation of our AWS datacenters. This includes services like H2C that provides a real time registry of all Amazon\u2019s servers, playing a central role in the provisioning of new capacity for Amazon services. It also includes services for network time (NTP), configuration management (CMF), and DHCP.&lt;br&gt;Our vision for the future of Enterprise Engineering is to define and deliver a new enterprise strategy for Amazon, driven by greater needs for Amazonians to be productive and collaborate with each other in more flexible ways, constantly being tested and driven at an incomparable level and scale of Amazon Web Services!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the software engineering role, your experience will become involved with the highest priorities including:&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; Continuous development of distributed (multi-tiered) systems, algorithms, and relational &amp;amp; NoSQL databases&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Design patterns, data structures, in test driven environment with projects on UI and server side&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Developing endpoint client software with design for scalability, performance and reliability.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Developing and publishing SOA (service oriented architecture) applications&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Fleet provisioning and configuration management at scale OR CI/CD pipeline build processes OR building services using AWS products - working in a high pace DevOps mindset culture.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Contributing to automation efforts for a team advancing the service ownership culture&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Completely embracing the entire AWS ecosystem and driving innovations on top of it&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Instilling in a culture that drives DevOps, holds a high-quality bar with code reviews, drives automation efforts to empower, and removes barriers for your team&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Building services that can scale across hundreds of thousands clients used by Amazonians worldwide&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Maintaining current technical knowledge of rapidly changing technology, always on the lookout for new technologies, and working with leaders of development teams to evolve current processes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Working with others on the engineering team to participate in day-to-day development activities, contributing to architecture decisions, participating in designs, design reviews, and implementation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Building services that can scale across hundreds of thousands clients used by Amazonians worldwide&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Maintaining current technical knowledge of rapidly changing technology, always on the lookout for new technologies, and working with leaders of development teams to evolve current processes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Basic Qualifications&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; 2+ years of non-internship professional software development experience&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Programming experience with at least one modern language such as Java, C++, or C# including object-oriented design&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; 1+ years of experience contributing to the architecture and design (architecture, design patterns, reliability and scaling) of new and current systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;POOLING&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Preferred Qualifications&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; Excellent written and verbal communication skills&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Programming experience with at least one modern language such as Java, C++, or C# including object-oriented design&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Solid software development background including design patterns, data structures, test driven development&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Experience with distributed (multi-tiered) systems, algorithms, and relational &amp;amp; NoSQL databases&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Experience with fleet provisioning and configuration management at scale&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Experience with CI/CD pipeline build processes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Experience building services using AWS products.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Experience working in a high pace DevOps mindset culture.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Meets/exceeds Amazon\u2019s leadership principles requirements for this role&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Meets/exceeds Amazon\u2019s functional/technical depth and complexity for this role&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Amazon is committed to a diverse and inclusive workplace.
