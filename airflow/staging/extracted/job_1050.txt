The Senior Data Engineer is responsible for preparing the Data Foundation in SCAN. They play a significant role in designing how we as manufacturing organization consume data from our Azure ADLS2 and other cloud storage solutions. They build and then maintain efficient and stable data pipelines that facilitate deeper analysis and reporting by data scientists, analysts, and hobbyists within JSC under the data architecture crafted by the JSC Digital Strategy and Manufacturing for the Future Strategy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principal Responsibilities&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Should you join us, you will assemble large, sophisticated data sets that meet business requirements. These will be built from raw and unstructured data, including sensor data, user-input data, operational-data, and transactional data. You will build and maintain an efficient data pipeline architecture using appropriate programming languages (e.g., python, R, scala, spark, \u2026), cloud computing tools (e.g., Databricks) and big data storage formats (e.g., Apache Parquet, Databricks Delta tables).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You will develop sustainable algorithms and pipelines to help make raw data usable for data analysis and visualization across JSC. You will assure these tools are aligned with the JSC data architecture, helping us to develop scalable solutions that enable better decisions, increased reliability, and improved business performance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You will provide thought leadership to a highly diverse data engineering and science team, driving a culture of accountability. Working with our IT partners you will ensure our data architecture is fit-for-purpose. You will lead the way in building the software stack that powers SCAN with your strong programming know-how.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To be most effective, you show an ability to learn the key business processes and their systems as well as the data used and generated by these processes. You have the willingness to work with in- and external partners to translate the data into business opportunities through data analytics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Up for the challenge?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Qualifications&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Required Qualification&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Advanced experience in software and data pipeline development using cloud solutions (e.g., Azure, AWS, GCP)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;A strong technical understanding of ETL processes, data analytics tools and their associated technologies and a proven eye for business&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Excellent coding skills including Python and/or R and their spark libraries (pyspark, sparklyr).
