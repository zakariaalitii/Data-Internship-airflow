When Square started, it was difficult and expensive (or just plain impossible) for some businesses to take credit cards. Square made credit card payments possible for all by turning a mobile phone into a credit card reader. Since then Square has been building an entire business toolkit of both hardware and software products including Square Capital, Square Terminal, Square Payroll, and more. We\u2019re working to find new and better ways to help businesses succeed on their own terms\u2014and we\u2019re looking for people like you to help shape tomorrow at Square.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Job Description&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;As a software engineer on the Infrastructure Services team youll be building the API and management features that make obtaining and managing the computers to run software at Square a simple and straightforward process.
