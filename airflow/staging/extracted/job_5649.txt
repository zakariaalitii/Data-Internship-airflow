As a Data Scientist on the Experience Analytics team, you\u2019ll answer key questions about users, their in-product workflow, and the quality of the user experience for your product. You will partner with Design Researchers to build a deep understanding of users, competition and market, and conduct analyses in a fast-paced, agile environment. You\u2019ll have experience conducting a variety of analyses in different situations, from exploratory analyses to generate hypotheses, to building statistical models that quantify the impact of particular design changes. You\u2019ll inspire change at all stages of product development by delivering exciting oral, written and visual presentations about your findings. Your primary job as an advocate for our users is to help the product team understand what would make a user\u2019s experiences natural, useful and delightful.
