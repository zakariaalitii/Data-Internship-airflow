This will enable teams to be in control of their feature quality and take pride in their product, with minimal effort.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Central to this system will be ML models which can take user behavior logs and visual session logs as inputs and detect anomalies in data coverage/click patterns/information density and visual layouts across products. These anomalies that are detected will seed the patterns of product quality gaps, to be further analyzed and submitted by the teams as inputs into the system for regular validations. This is a new key investment for entire WebXT Org. To name a few products this service is expected to support are - Bing, Maps, Edge, Windows Feeds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are looking for someone who is passionate about formulating this ML problem and solving it in a generic way across products with high coverage and minimal noise, leveraging the richness of data available.
