We are developing a unified data catalog with a technical layer to enable a central system to capture and store the metadata. We are also building a compatible inference layer to help our users make sense of the stored business and operational metadata across all the datasets. We also plan to develop a centralized and pluggable policy engine that is well integrated with Apple's ecosystem and allows our stakeholders to customize and apply data policy rules for all datasets.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are creating these centralized infrastructure pieces to foster a broader data strategy here at Apple. These infrastructure pieces will provide visibility to Apple's datasets' taxonomy and business context. The work is impactful and focuses on solving data distributed systems problems relating to scale and efficiency.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education &amp;amp; Experience&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;BS, MS or Ph.D., in Computer Science, or equivalent experience.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Role Number: 200257984&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "Apple", "sameAs": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/apple", "logo": "https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C560BAQHdAaarsO-eyA/company-logo_200_200/0/1595530301220?e=1636588800&amp;v=beta&amp;t=TBgLFdE65ONXxYa-jBaUFYtuImVHxEZlt-klhRBHri8"}, "identifier": {"@type": "PropertyValue", "name": "Apple", "value": "200257984_en-US"}, "image": "https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C560BAQHdAaarsO-eyA/company-logo_100_100/0/1595530301220?e=1636588800&amp;v=beta&amp;t=MiEZ3awFiAz9q1YcTehSapjjXRo3o8IX5MDjHbDPHtk", "industry": "Consumer Electronics", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "US", "addressLocality": "Cupertino", "addressRegion": "CA", "postalCode": "95014", "streetAddress": null}, "latitude": 37.319313, "longitude": -122.02927}, "skills": "", "title": "Software Engineer", "validThrough": "2021-08-30T16:04:48.000Z", "educationRequirements": {"@type": "EducationalOccupationalCredential", "credentialCategory": "bachelor degree"}, "estimatedSalary": {"@type": "MonetaryAmount", "currency": "USD", "value": {"@type": "QuantitativeValue", "minValue": 118000, "maxValue": 200000, "unitText": "YEAR"}}}
