We have also built something even stronger and more valuable: an award-winning culture based on trust, empathy, collaboration, and ownership. By working together across typical dividing lines, we are better as a team than any of us could be apart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Do you have a passion for solving hard problems at scale? Are you eager to join a trust-based, globally-connected team, where your contributions will make a meaningful difference?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Come and see why Fortune Magazine consistently ranks The Trade Desk among best small-medium sized workplaces globally.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Who We Are&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The Trade Desk is leading the way to the future of marketing by changing how advertising is bought and sold. Working with the largest brands and agencies around the world, our technology platform helps consumers discover products they want by enabling advertisers to target and reach them on the right channels at the right time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Employees join The Trade Desk to discover opportunity, contribute to our customers\u2019 success, and be part of building the future of marketing. You\u2019ll work with creative, compassionate, and collaborative colleagues that share a passion for making the internet better for all \u2013 a combination that simply can't be beat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you join The Trade Desk, you\u2019re joining a family. We have open space work environments, adjustable sitting/standing desks, and a celebrated open-door policy (at all levels) that can inspire out-of-the-box solutions and camaraderie among your coworkers. The competitive compensation packages, full benefits, stock options, and additional discounted stock purchase opportunities, catered lunches, and offsite team building activities may cause slight to severe jealousy among your peers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What You Will Be Doing&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The Trade Desk is a rapidly growing company, as our CEO often says: \"we're only 2% done\". We are facing the biggest paradigm shift in advertising in the last century as the industry moves towards data-driven, results-oriented advertising.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The only way for our company to meet the massive opportunity ahead is if we are operating at peak efficiency and our employees are equipped with the best tools and technology available.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That's our team's responsibility and our customers are the business units within The Trade Desk (Sales, Marketing, Legal, Finance, Product, Engineering, etc.).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are looking for a Product Manager to help us identify and deploy the best enterprise systems to help our teams operate at peak efficiency. Some of the systems you\u2019ll be working with are CRM, CLM, HRIS, ERP, and EPM. We also have a host of other systems that our employees leverage to do their jobs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While these systems are often powerful, they are not always easy or delightful for end users. We are looking for someone that can bridge the gap of understanding how to leverage these powerful systems, while also having strong customer empathy. You are comfortable conversing about strategy with business unit leadership, while also digging into implementation details with your Solution Architects.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Types Of Challenges You Should Enjoy Tackling Are&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;li&gt; Identifying gaps in our current enterprise stack&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Gathering requirements and success criteria from the various business stakeholders&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Helping select vendors whose technology is a match for our high standards&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Working with Solution Architects or Systems Integrators to build out functionality to support key use cases&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Coordination of deployment and training for new systems&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Managing the enhancement backlog and roadmap (you\u2019ll be the product owner)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Communicating with business unit stakeholders and senior company leadership on a regular cadence to ensure alignment&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What You Bring To The Table&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vision&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;You can imagine the future, understand where we need to go, and articulate it to the rest of your team. While your execution focus is on the work in front of you, your planning focus is on the months, quarters, and years ahead to make sure we\u2019re steering the ship in a good direction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project Leadership&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;You can pick out what's important from the noise. In a sea of opportunity, you zero in on what should be a priority and drive towards the work that will deliver the best results.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Passion&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;You hold yourself to a high standard of excellence and care deeply about the work you deliver. You're willing to champion your ideas, even in the face of adversity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People First&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;We want self-aware people who can engage in a healthy exchange of ideas but understand that people always come first. We want someone we can celebrate our successes with, lament our losses, and that pushes us to always keep an unrelenting focus on our customers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;User Experience&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;You've got a nose for what a good product is versus a mediocre or bad one. You have opinions about how products should look, behave, and feel, and can articulate where something isn't meeting your quality bar and why.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Execution&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;We are only as good as the impact we make. You think about the value you're delivering, rather than just the work you're doing. You know that shipping is crucial, and your customers have a right to expect the best from you. You have a track record of successfully delivering products and technical solutions with strong outcomes for your customers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analytical&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Being data-driven is at the core of our company's DNA. Digging deep into data and numbers is a comfortable place for you, and you've demonstrated an understanding of what insights will have the largest impact to an organization.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;You're not the one building things, but you absolutely have to understand how they work. You're comfortable ramping up on new technology and can have meaningful discussions about implementation trade-offs with developers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nice-to-haves&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience working with distributed teams - we have over 20 offices globally&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience in the advertising technology space&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You have experience deploying a variety of enterprise systems at scale&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Our Compensation And Benefits (for Colorado Residents Only)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;li&gt; Base Compensation Range: $60,800 - $199,500&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Our Compensation And Benefits (for Colorado Residents Only)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;li&gt; Base Compensation Range: $60,800 - $199,500&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;In accordance with Colorado law, the range provided is The Trade Desk\u2019s reasonable estimate of the base compensation for this role.
