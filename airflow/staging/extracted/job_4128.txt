We enable people to transform data into something visual and understandable, enabling people to make important decisions based on those insights. Our primary mission is to help all people see and understand the meaning behind the world\u2019s data, covering a wealth of domains from social justice to health care to environmental issues. If you are passionate about technology, but also care deeply about doing something meaningful, Tableau is the place for you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tableau Public plays an important role in connecting people with relevant, high-quality data stories. This role has been more important than ever as the world struggles to understand the impact of COVID 19. Tableau has taken a position as a source of trusted data and analysis for COVID19, and Tableau Public has been the backbone of this effort. There has been a surge in Tableau adoption, as local and state governments, as well as public health institutions, are communicating important COVID19 data and statistics with their constituents using Tableau Public visualizations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Besides helping people see and understand their data, we also have some really fun architectural and scaling challenges. Tableau Public is the largest Tableau deployment in the world and has the largest data visualization repository in a single place. In addition to supporting the busiest Tableau server in production, our team has been a front-runner at Tableau in exploring new technologies. Tableau Public was one of the first teams to transition to AWS, Kuberbetes, Docker, and React, and we continuously strive to leverage emerging products to help us improve our customer's experiences on the platform.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What We\u2019re Looking For \u2026&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;This role will have the opportunity to be a strong technical contributor on our middle tier team, driving towards next-gen SaaS architecture and deployment strategies. We\u2019re looking for someone well-versed in a variety of technologies and languages, and is an expert in Enterprise Java, SaaS, and Containerization. It\u2019s also important that you\u2019re familiar with transitioning larger legacy services to modern architecture strategies, e.g. breaking up a monolith to microservices or moving an on-prem product to SaaS. Experience in engineering practices around continuous deployment would be an asset. Finally, you should love learning new things, being a mentor, and leading by example as you push for engineering excellence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some of the things you\u2019ll be doing include \u2026&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; Development of the Tableau Public specific backend services, which leverage Tableau Server for its core functionality. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Helping the team to continue building robust and scalable services leveraging cloud based infrastructure. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Experimenting with newer technologies and champion them as needed. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Contribute to the design, development, test and operational excellence of Java services and libraries supporting Tableau Public. This includes participating in on-call support for our services on a rotational basis. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Work closely with product management and other internal partner teams to understand requirements and strategically incorporate them into the platform. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Participate in design and code reviews, breaking down and estimating work, and selecting and incorporating appropriate tools and frameworks for the job. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Uphold a high standard of engineering excellence in source code, testing and operations. You will proactively anticipate risks and take steps to mitigate them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Who You Are\u2026&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experienced . You are a Java expert and have 5+ years of experience with large systems and the variety of common frameworks and libraries popular in Java shops. You also have experience with agile development methodology, and you understand what it takes to write software that is used by millions of people. You love writing things that \"just work\" - things that are robust, secure, scalable, and that perform well. You think far enough ahead to avoid tech debt, but know how to avoid over-engineering. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Technical. You are well versed with Spring, Hibernate or any other ORM, and have worked with a variety of relational and NoSQL databases. Your personal software practices ensure you deliver high quality even under schedule pressure. You believe in automation and writing tests for your own code as a way of maintaining high quality in your products. You know how to find the slow queries, caching problems, and how to successfully scale a SaaS service. You understand traditional architectures, but also understand and have worked with Microservices architecture enough to know the pros and cons and where the right balance is. It would be an asset if you have worked with Docker and Kubernetes. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Team Player . You enjoy collaborating with, learning from, and teaching others (including across disciplines) so we all become better. You\u2019ve been a tech lead and really enjoy mentoring and leading projects and technical excellence within the team. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Motivated . You do good work, you have a growth mindset. You strive to be the best you can each day. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You are a Recruiter!
