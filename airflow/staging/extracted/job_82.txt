The ideal candidate would be a skilled SW generalist with a great investigative attitude and strong sense of curiosity. Previous experience in working on large scale projects is a great plus as well as having a full understanding of the overall system. In addition, experience on product lifecycle from conception through shipping is required. Specifically, his/her responsibilities will span from writing and debugging SW specific to a product (communication services, drivers, UI etc) to efficiently integrate general platform services provided by other teams.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Qualifications&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;You will have more than 7+ years hands on experience on integration of medium/large projects based on a full OS: Linux, Android, or BSD. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You will be proficient in C and C++ with both kernel and user space programming. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Strong experience in debugging complex systems fundamental. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Experience in large scale production support is a plus. Ability to easily and quickly move between different areas is a big plus. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Experience working on cross functional projects between Engineering, QA, operations would be a huge plus. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;May require some travel to china for factory support.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;This is a highly technical role. The Product Development will directly maintain a number of product specific services such as UI, Power management tuning, system control and drivers but the team is fundamentally responsible for the overall SW running on a product and the successful integration of the full device. This team will work with a large number of Engineering teams (HW and SW) and QA to analyze global failures and act as first responders as well as own the full lifecycle of a product.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education &amp;amp; Experience&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;BS/CS/EE/CE or relevant work experience&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Role Number: 200248125&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "Apple", "sameAs": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/apple", "logo": "https://media-exp3.licdn.com/dms/image/C560BAQHdAaarsO-eyA/company-logo_200_200/0/1595530301220?e=1634169600&amp;v=beta&amp;t=Z75eh_Hzk0N021POgBkmPxcRjDNX_6dndjW9sIVsQO0"}, "identifier": {"@type": "PropertyValue", "name": "Apple", "value": "200248125_en-US"}, "image": "https://media-exp3.licdn.com/dms/image/C560BAQHdAaarsO-eyA/company-logo_100_100/0/1595530301220?e=1634169600&amp;v=beta&amp;t=bt-hDFnMm8oXxesFhp4-SQ3R3BGwRx5SXFQfkZvlmFM", "industry": "Consumer Electronics", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "US", "addressLocality": "Culver City", "addressRegion": "CA", "postalCode": "90232", "streetAddress": null}, "latitude": 34.0225, "longitude": -118.39429}, "skills": "", "title": "Systems Software Engineer", "validThrough": "2021-08-08T19:59:20.000Z", "educationRequirements": {"@type": "EducationalOccupationalCredential", "credentialCategory": "bachelor degree"}, "experienceRequirements": {"@type": "OccupationalExperienceRequirements", "monthsOfExperience": 84}, "estimatedSalary": {"@type": "MonetaryAmount", "currency": "USD", "value": {"@type": "QuantitativeValue", "minValue": 82100, "maxValue": 178100, "unitText": "YEAR"}}}
