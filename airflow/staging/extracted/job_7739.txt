Today the company runs one of the world\u2019s largest networks that powers approximately 25 million Internet properties, for customers ranging from individual bloggers to SMBs to Fortune 500 companies. Cloudflare protects and accelerates any Internet application online without adding hardware, installing software, or changing a line of code. Internet properties powered by Cloudflare all have web traffic routed through its intelligent global network, which gets smarter with every request. As a result, they see significant improvement in performance and a decrease in spam and other attacks. Cloudflare was named to Entrepreneur Magazine\u2019s Top Company Cultures list and ranked among the World\u2019s Most Innovative Companies by Fast Company.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We realize people do not fit into neat boxes. We are looking for curious and empathetic individuals who are committed to developing themselves and learning new skills, and we are ready to help you do that. We cannot complete our mission without building a diverse and inclusive team. We hire the best people based on an evaluation of their potential and support them throughout their time at Cloudflare. Come join us!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About The Department&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Cloudflare\u2019s Engineering Team builds and runs the software that handles a large number of HTTP requests on the Internet today. We also build and run the internal tools that build and run our software. The Engineering Team is split into two groups: one handles product development and the other handles operations. Product development covers both new features and functionality and scaling our existing software to meet the challenges of a massively growing customer base. The operations team handles one of the world\u2019s largest networks with data centers in 102 cities worldwide.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What You'll Do&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Cloudflare is looking for a backend engineer to help us build and maintain the codebase that powers both our customer APIs as well as internal service APIs. This is a role for engineers that are familiar with standard web backend architecture, and capable in database design and interaction. Our API platform is under constant load and scrutiny, so experience and commitment to easily understood and tested code is also a key part of the role. Your ability to visualize the flow of data through a complex application is critical to your success, and to the team\u2019s. You will be working closely with the product team to understand and document the functional needs of their product requirements, developing new code to solve new problems, as well as maintaining existing code to squash bugs. Our web stack is based on PHP, Redis, and Postgres, but you'll also need to consider the nature of REST APIs, database management, and deployment workflows. Knowledge of PHP is not a must, but deep familiarity with web favored languages is (Python, Ruby, Golang).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Examples Of Desirable Skills, Knowledge And Experience&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; 3+ years of experience building large-scale software applications &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Experience designing and integrating RESTful APIs &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Knowledge of SQL and common relational database systems such as PostgreSQL and MySQL &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Excellent debugging and optimization skills &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Experience using backend web frameworks &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Unit/integration testing experience &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Experience working with FE engineers and collaborating across teams &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonus Points&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; Familiarity with containerization development workflows &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Familiarity with PostgreSQL stored procedure development &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Makes Cloudflare Special?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;We\u2019re not just a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company. We\u2019re a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company with a soul. Fundamental to our mission to help build a better Internet is protecting the free and open Internet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project Galileo&lt;/strong&gt; : We equip politically and artistically important organizations and journalists with powerful tools to defend themselves against attacks that would otherwise censor their work, technology already used by Cloudflare\u2019s enterprise customers--at no cost.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Athenian Project &lt;/strong&gt; : We created Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Path Forward Partnership&lt;/strong&gt; : Since 2016, we have partnered with Path Forward, a nonprofit organization, to create 16-week positions for mid-career professionals who want to get back to the workplace after taking time off to care for a child, parent, or loved one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.1.1.1&lt;/strong&gt; : We released 1.1.1.1 to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here\u2019s the deal - we don\u2019t store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by our privacy commitment and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sound like something you\u2019d like to be a part of?
