We offer a great collaborative atmosphere in a bright open space. You\u2019ll be responsible for small and large projects, some tactical, others strategic, that directly impact our business. You will have the opportunity to contribute value across our entire stack: cloud computing, distributed computing, data management, advanced financial analytics, sophisticated data visualization and web applications. You will also have the opportunity to receive training on our stack as well as financial analytics, work with talented team members and provide input on our research and product development roadmaps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About You&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You love software. Whether you just graduated, or have a few years of experience, whether you are a developer by training or just happen to use programming in another field, you have always been more curious of how software works than your peers. Legacy and modern programming languages, operating systems, distributed systems, open source frameworks, how concepts and implementations compare and contrast. And you have been satisfying this curiosity, accumulating over time exceptional technical breadth and depth. You don\u2019t want to stop. You want to be part of a team of like-minded learners and doers to build something big and interesting that is changing the way that Wall Street looks at complex financial instruments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About Us&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KANERAI was formed by a unique team of entrepreneurial and talented Wall Street traders, quants, technologists and scientists who shared a passion for technology and the vision to empower investors with unprecedented insight into complex derivative instruments.
