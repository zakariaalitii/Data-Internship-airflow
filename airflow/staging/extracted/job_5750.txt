The person in this role will be essential in identifying target customers for an early stage product, finding repeatable patterns in customer usage, cultivating the pilot customer pipeline, and training advocates across the broader Twilio sales organization to amplify your impact. The Twilio AI's product line enables our customers to understand the meaning of every customer interaction they have, and drive automation flows based on the content of what their customers are saying to improve business outcomes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Twilio is looking for a leader who lives the Twilio Magic . They also:&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have the ability to listen to customer needs, understand the key decision makers within a company and their motivations, and translate the product capabilities to metrics that matter to our customers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are curious, collaborative and have a high EQ. You know how to thrive in a fast-paced, early stage environment while also understanding the constraints and capability of a large go to market engine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Crafting a go to market muscle where there is no playbook to look at, no prior art to copy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Think strategically about how to replicate early success and have proven your ability to do so.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have experience working with a remote and diverse international team, and collaborating with product and engineering across multiple time zones.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are a phenomenal communicator. Whether it's on stage to inspire people in your vision, in a meeting with C-level customer execs, or in writing explaining strategy. You understand the power of great communication, and strive to always be improving at it. You also use those skills to be a connector - you have a knack for connecting people and building significant relationships.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have experience working with product management, and understand how to feed in customer-informed guidance and aggregate feedback, while leaving space and autonomy on the 'how'.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can converse credibly with engineering leaders in a customer organization. You do not need to have experience with Machine Learning, but you will need to be able to learn quickly as you go.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Build process where it's needed. You know how to cut through bureaucracy when it's inefficient, but also how to create structure when it's needed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;DON\u2019T SETTLE: Any early stage product has hurdles both internally and externally to navigate. When you find a roadblock, you keep searching for how to best move forward, whether that's on your own or by building advocacy across an organization.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;WEAR THE CUSTOMER\u2019S SHOES: Collaborate on roadmaps with product and engineering leaders across San Francisco, Colombia, Prague, Denver, Madrid, and London to ensure the team has clear direction (the \u2018why!\u2019) and priorities rooted in customer data.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;EMPOWER OTHERS: Provide the continuous voice of the customer to our product team. Act as an ambassador for the product and enable folks across the broader Twilio Sales and Marketing teams to be able to replicate your success.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;BE INCLUSIVE: Recognize the important decisions your team faces and give meaningful advice, based on customer use cases while understanding that every person has different view points and diversity makes us stronger.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;WRITE IT DOWN: Institute standard methodologies in replicating and scaling early success - ensure the broader team understands and communicates the problem and solution well both verbally and in writing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;BE AN OWNER: Hunt down the things that are unknown. Seek out the challenges. And find the path from problem to resolution to large scale success..&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Travel required - up to 50% of the time post-COVID&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Today, Twilio powers the delivery of billions of the world\u2019s communications. Customer conversations are one of the most insightful indicators of a product and business\u2019 health. They cover every time a customer was delighted, frustrated, buying more, closing their account, needing help, etc. But usually those conversations are trapped away in a black box, analyzed only by listening to them one by one, or with basic keyword search capabilities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Twilio AI team is building a platform that uses machine learning to transcribe, categorise, and extract meaning out of customer conversations so companies can evaluate every one of them and build workflows that automate actions, like prioritizing high value leads to follow up on or identifying customers likely to churn. Our goal is to help companies power more effective business processes and better customer engagement, by understanding the meaning in every conversation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Twilio is a company that is empowering the world\u2019s developers with modern communication in order to build better applications.
