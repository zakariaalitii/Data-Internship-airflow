The mission requires a strong offense and a steadfast defense. The offense collects, processes and disseminates intelligence information derived from foreign signals for intelligence and counterintelligence purposes. The defense prevents adversaries from gaining access to sensitive classified national security information. The need to maintain our core Computer Science group is vital to provide the technical capabilities necessary to successfully execute NSA's mission. The increased complexity of supporting NSA's mission requires world class researchers, programmers, and developers who operate in teams in areas such as software engineering, information technology infrastructure, high performance computing, data science, architectures, computer security, and networking in order to design and develop advanced tools, techniques, and systems. Given the pace of technologies and myriad of adversaries in the cyber realm and foreign nation state actors, Software Engineers at the NSA develop the technologies and abilities to maintain our advantage in both national defense and information gathering. Software Engineers help collect data, extract value, route and manage at scale, build user interfaces, protect our systems, and identify and develop support infrastructure as a service provider to the Agency and Intelligence Community. As a Software Engineer, your responsibilities can include: - creating applications that scale across an entire data center - identifying and retrieving the most important pieces of information out of 100s of petabytes of data - leveraging open source software - integrating off-the-shelf and government developed software - leading new advances in computer science and riding the bleeding edge of computing technologies: - microprocessor-based advances - beyond the horizon supercomputers - signals processing (including analog control) - user interfaces - deep learning - information security - the design and implementation of encryption - advanced algorithms&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Job Summary&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Does solving unique problems energize you? Do you like to create distinctive solutions? The difference between NSA Computer Scientists and others are the problems we MUST solve. Our culture believes in solving \"unsolvable\" problems, which we do by creating new science and new technologies not yet discovered, that will protect and advance our Nation in the 4th Industrial Revolution.
