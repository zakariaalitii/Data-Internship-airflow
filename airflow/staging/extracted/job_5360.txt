You\u2019ll be part of Advanced Design (AD) within Design Enablement organization (DE). The team works in close collaboration with our partners in process technology and design teams spanning CPU, Graphics, Networking, and Servers. The primary focus of the team is to accurately predict the impact of process changes on density scaling and power, performance metrics thereby facilitating quick data-based decisions for scaling and power, performance commits going from one tech node to the next.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About The Role&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;On this team you will research machine learning (ML) algorithms to provide Intel with the latest offerings in this extremely fast changing space. You will also build services and APIs to allow efficient and safe access to the ML algorithms which will enable the creation of visualizations to help customers analyze their results to achieve their desired outcomes. And, you will be working closely with hardware engineers in debugging and analyzing their model performance. It is an exciting time and with your skill and expertise we can help create the next generation technology which will shape our future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Minimum Qualifications&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Qualifications&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The candidate must possess a master's degree (with 2+ years of industry experience) or PhD degree (with 1+ years of industry experience) in Computer Science with a focus on Machine Learning or related Engineering disciplines&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;Using modern machine learning frameworks scikit-opt and scikit-learn&lt;li&gt;Data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented design patterns&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Python3 and its related APIs&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Preferred Qualifications&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Background in optimization algorithms, active learning, Bayesian machine learning&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience in developing service-oriented, microservice, multi-tiered and distributed architectures&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Analytical expertise in using R, building visualizations, debugging, and diagnosing machine learning models&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Semiconductor industry experience&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Experience with the one or more of the following (more than one preferred):&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;MongoDB and/or PostgreSQL&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Javascript, HTML, Typescript, and/or React.js&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tensorflow and/or AutoML&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;#designenablement&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inside this Business Group&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;As the world's largest chip manufacturer, Intel strives to make every facet of semiconductor manufacturing state-of-the-art -- from semiconductor process development and manufacturing, through yield improvement to packaging, final test and optimization, and world class Supply Chain and facilities support.
