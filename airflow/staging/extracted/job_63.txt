The common thread through each of our product lines is the belief that success in education is driven by relationships, and the Remind communication platform is where the next generation of education relationships live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About this role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reporting into the Head of Data, you will be the functional expert, leader, and architect of our data platform.
