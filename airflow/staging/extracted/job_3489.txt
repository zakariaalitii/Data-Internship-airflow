{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "JobPosting", "datePosted": "2021-08-12T16:25:43.000Z", "description": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overview:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\tKinoTek is revolutionizing the movement industry by making cutting edge motion capture technology and data visualization techniques accessible to physical therapists, chiropractors, and their clinics. Traditionally, these tools have only been available to professional sports teams and high end medical facilities. KinoTek is changing this by leveraging the power of the cloud and the latest advancements in computer vision technology to enhance treatment communication and patient outcomes at clinics of all sizes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\tOur first product uses the Azure Kinect, a 3D LiDAR based camera, to collect spatial data of an individual\u2019s movement. Our platform uses this data to compute quantitative metrics such as joint range of motion, musculoskeletal asymmetries, and postural assessments. This information is visualized in a browser-based application that clinicians can review and analyze with their clients in the context of a single assessment, or in terms of their broader treatment protocol when looking at how these metrics compare over time. This provides a platform for the clinician to interact with their clients and share specific, individualized information to build trust and understanding into the treatment process.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\tKinoTek is currently in beta with a cohort of providers across the United States using the platform in their clinics. During this time, we are working to enhance the product based on customer feedback while preparing the platform to scale into the market following product launch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your Role:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\tYou will be working in a small, driven team where the ability to be agile, problem solve, and learn quickly are a must. Given the relatively early stage of the company and the product, you will play a large role in shaping the technical implementation of our products. As a result, there is a high degree of autonomy in the role, but also a high level of responsibility.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your Responsibilities:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understand and contribute to the product from a full stack perspective.&lt;/strong&gt; Everyone on the team is given the opportunity and expected to learn all components of the software. We strive to combat siloing as much as possible. In the short term however, this role will primarily be for a frontend engineer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assist the team in developing a robust testing strategy.&lt;/strong&gt; As our product matures from MVP to a scalable production application, we are working to put procedures in place to catch errors before they are shipped. Do you have opinions on or experience with tools and techniques for implementing testing? Here\u2019s a chance to take ownership and help the team ensure that code can be shipped with peace of mind.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work with the team to continuously improve our software release efficiency by implementing and enhancing CI/CD.&lt;/strong&gt; We geek out for good CI/CD because it ultimately means better developer quality of life. If you enjoy devops, this is another area to take ownership and explore new technologies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Actively contribute to R&amp;amp;D efforts.&lt;/strong&gt; KinoTek is very much in the early stages of product development. That means that we are constantly vetting new technologies and developing innovative ways to accomplish our product goals. We are looking for individuals who can leverage their curiosities, passions, and prior experiences to guide technology adoption and integration.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Share knowledge in areas that the team may lack, and actively learn from the team in areas that you may lack.&lt;/strong&gt; Skill enrichment is something that is emphasized by default in a startup environment, but we lean into it as much as we can.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Requirements:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;You must have proficiency in at least 3 of the below \u201ccore technical skills\u201d.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You must have familiarity with at least 10 of any of the skills/fields listed below.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You should have approximately 3 or more years of professional experience in a similar or adjacent technical field.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The ability to work in the office at least part time is preferred.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This position is open to U.S. workers, including citizens, permanent residence, asylees, and refugees.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Core Technical Skills:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;C# / .NET Core (REST APIs)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;JavaScript (React)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Databases (SQL and/or NoSQL)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Azure (or other cloud service provider)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Git &amp;amp; GitHub&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nice-to-have Skills:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some form of Agile experience&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;MongoDB&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Material UI&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Three.js&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Next.js&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Automated Testing (Jest, Cypress.io)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Linux, Docker&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mobile Development (cross platform)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Computer Vision&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience in other languages and frameworks&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "KinoTek", "sameAs": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/kinoteksoftware", "logo": "https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D0BAQGAOZgVkRfEXw/company-logo_200_200/0/1628870791283?e=1637193600&amp;v=beta&amp;t=KQPu_YYAjqba4wHL21cEz51lTDEOqdA_TAtACV15-ls"}, "identifier": {"@type": "PropertyValue", "name": "KinoTek"}, "image": "https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D0BAQGAOZgVkRfEXw/company-logo_100_100/0/1628870791283?e=1637193600&amp;v=beta&amp;t=A4Wh2EAL35eFYr84ZcaO3-vd8ZmoHx9YW1Z5b9JV60o", "industry": "", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "US", "addressLocality": "Portland", "addressRegion": "ME", "postalCode": "04104", "streetAddress": null}, "latitude": 43.659218, "longitude": -70.256516}, "skills": "", "title": "Software Engineer", "validThrough": "2021-09-11T16:25:43.000Z", "educationRequirements": {"@type": "EducationalOccupationalCredential", "credentialCategory": "bachelor degree"}, "experienceRequirements": {"@type": "OccupationalExperienceRequirements", "monthsOfExperience": 36}}
