As a Research Scientist, you'll setup large-scale tests and deploy promising ideas quickly and broadly, managing deadlines and deliverables while applying the latest theories to develop new and improved products, processes, or technologies. From creating experiments and prototyping implementations to designing new architectures, our research scientists work on real-world problems that span the breadth of computer science, such as machine (and deep) learning, data mining, natural language processing, hardware and software performance analysis, improving compilers for mobile platforms, as well as core search and much more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a Research Scientist, you'll also actively contribute to the wider research community by sharing and publishing your findings, with ideas inspired by internal projects as well as from collaborations with research programs at partner universities and technical institutes all over the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The hardware team focuses on laying the technological, scientific, and engineering foundations for making large-scale quantum computing a reality. Our architectures are based on superconducting qubits that are cooled near absolute zero and controlled by high speed signals. The key challenge is achieving and maintain high fidelity quantum operations as we scale up. Our effort is based on the successful development of gates, signal delivery hardware, benchmarking techniques, quantum control, and quantum devices.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a Research Scientist, you'll work with other research scientists and engineers to address these exciting challenges, which lie at the intersection of physical insight, metrology, and engineering.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Research happens at Google everyday, on many different embedded teams throughout the company. Our research reaches the user through both services and products such as Search, Maps, Google Assistant, Google Translate, Google Cloud and our computing, storage, and networking infrastructure. To achieve this, we\u2019re working on a wide variety of projects that utilize the latest state-of-the-art technologies that push the boundaries of what is possible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Responsibilities&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Focus on understanding the fundamental aspects of our quantum system and improving its performance&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Develop metrology tools to characterize system performance&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Develop gates, control solutions, and automated calibrations, and benchmark on qubits &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Characterize and design next-generation quantum devices&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Characterize next-generation signal delivery and classical-quantum interfaces &lt;/li&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Google is proud to be an equal opportunity workplace and is an affirmative action employer.
