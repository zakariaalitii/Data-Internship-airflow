What does that mean? We've developed reusable packages that can be used over 200 times and are pairing it with a digital platform consisting of a software management system and IOT driven hardware sensor. Think goodbye single-use boxes piling up at our door, hello smart package of the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Join us as we re-imagine the e-commerce experience. We are seeking a Software Engineer to execute against a number of key tasks for our web and mobile-based apps.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So how will you spend your days?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You\u2019ll be one of our first hires of a fast-growing team! There are fundamental, technical, and architectural decisions to make. There are key user experiences to develop, iterate, and innovate on. There are best practices to solidify. You\u2019ll be building a product, and you\u2019ll be establishing the foundation for a world-class engineering department.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Stack&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;React&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;NodeJS (Express.js)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;MongoDB&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who are you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Care deeply about UX \u2013 User experience is at the forefront of how we create intuitive, innovative, and beautiful products that people love. We strive to learn and understand our users\u2019 needs, behaviors, and emotions to gather insights that inform product strategy and design.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;An insightful problem solver, capable of autonomously defining and executing on a technical vision, but eager to collaborate on it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Excited to join an early-stage startup, and clear-eyed about the scrappiness, flexibility, and resilience that it requires.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you know?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Front-end expertise. Deep proficiency with at least one modern front-end framework, including interaction design, animation, and performance optimization.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;JavaScript expertise. An expert in the ins and outs of the language. Having strong opinions (loosely held) on best practices and design patterns.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Although we know that years of experience isn\u2019t always the best indicator of talent, at least 5 years of focused Javascript experience is what we imagine. JS has changed a lot over the years and you should have some historical knowledge of past versions of JS.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We understand that sometimes the best engineers aren\u2019t the ones who \u2018check all the boxes\u2019. We also value and support individual growth, which means not knowing something isn\u2019t as important as your ability and willingness to learn it. If you answer \u201cyes\u201d to the majority of the skills and traits above, and you\u2019re excited to develop the others, then you\u2019re someone we\u2019d love to talk with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compensation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a remote role, with salary + equity + benefit compensation.&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "LimeLoop", "sameAs": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/limeloop", "logo": "https://media-exp3.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D0BAQHVLA7XnE8JSQ/company-logo_200_200/0/1619467844754?e=1634774400&amp;v=beta&amp;t=RMYXHkwKPv_aXUYhBr_SreyIpH-zjFIJDvt4FNjGijE"}, "identifier": {"@type": "PropertyValue", "name": "LimeLoop"}, "image": "https://media-exp3.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D0BAQHVLA7XnE8JSQ/company-logo_100_100/0/1619467844754?e=1634774400&amp;v=beta&amp;t=r76DhzWYyTbpil7fSoSD07j-MYwVfOw8hQSVQyE3Z-k", "industry": "", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "US", "addressLocality": "New York", "addressRegion": "United States", "postalCode": "13856", "streetAddress": null}, "latitude": 42.93923, "longitude": -75.62005}, "skills": "", "title": "Software Engineer", "validThrough": "2022-01-11T18:45:10.000Z", "educationRequirements": {"@type": "EducationalOccupationalCredential", "credentialCategory": "bachelor degree"}, "experienceRequirements": {"@type": "OccupationalExperienceRequirements", "monthsOfExperience": 60}, "jobLocationType": "TELECOMMUTE", "applicantLocationRequirements": {"@type": "Country", "name": "United States"}}
