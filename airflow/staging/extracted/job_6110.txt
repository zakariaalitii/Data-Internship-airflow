Our mission is to power how the world works together. Box is partnering with enterprise organizations to accelerate their digital transformation by creating a single platform for secure content management, collaboration and workflow. We have an amazing opportunity to further establish ourselves as leaders in the space, and we need strong advocates to help us achieve that goal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By joining Box, you will have the unique opportunity to help capture a majority of this developing market and define what content management looks like for the digital enterprise. Today, Box powers over 98,000 businesses, including 70% of the Fortune 500 who trust Box to manage their content in the cloud.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHY BOX NEEDS YOU &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The Observability Platforms team provides an end-to-end experience enabling Box engineers by leveraging frameworks, tools, APIs and visualizations to better understand the behavior of features, services, and infrastructure they own and maintain. The team also helps educate product, infrastructure, and systems teams on how to appropriately monitor features and services they own, provide visualizations for monitoring distributed systems, give guidance for reducing operational overhead, and supports the delivery of unmatched availability to our customers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We need a Sr. SRE with the experience of having designed, operated, and implemented Observability frameworks at a very large scale, and well versed in the operation of scaled architectures. You should have deep operational knowledge of distributed systems and how to avoid limitations through innovative design.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHY BOX NEEDS YOU &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The main focus of the Observability Team is to build frameworks and systems that can manage the performance of Box systems while scaling to billions of events per second. Additionally, we are responsible to standardize observability across engineering teams, drive designs for high performing services and foster great observability practices. We build, scale, and operate low-latency, high-throughput data systems that power high resiliency of Box Systems. You will help us execute on this vision and ensure that Box continues to ship scalable services that can hold against the high-performance expectation from our customers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are looking for big thinkers and innovators who have experience working with scalable distributed systems and have a passion for high performance and reliability. We are a small team with big ambitions that values impact and is not afraid of huge, gnarly problems. If this excites you, come join us!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What You'll Do&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;You're going to have the unique opportunity to build, improve, and support our Observability (o11y) platform.
