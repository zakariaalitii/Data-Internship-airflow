Through our family of apps and services, we're building a different kind of company that connects billions of people around the world, gives them ways to share what matters most to them, and helps bring people closer together. Whether we're creating new products or helping a small business expand its reach, people at Facebook are builders at heart. Our global teams are constantly iterating, solving problems, and working together to empower people around the world to build community and connect in meaningful ways. Together, we can help people build stronger communities - we're just getting started.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Instagram Core Growth team is focused on increasing the size of the Instagram Community. We do this by communicating the value of Instagram to people who are not yet on the platform, allowing new users to easily create and access their Instagram accounts, and make sure existing users are able to connect to their friends and interests on Instagram. This work has led to Instagram having tremendous growth over the past several years and as we\u2019ve grown, the low hanging fruit has diminished. We will need you to tackle some of the thorniest issues that the Core Growth team is faced with, and help us accelerate our user growth. We\u2019re looking for a strong Data Scientist to help us accelerate this trajectory. This is an opportunity to join an organization that has driven the expansion of one of the largest consumer apps in the world. If you\u2019re looking to guide our strategy for the next phase of growth, excited about wrestling with thorny data problems, and want to join a world-class team, this is the right role for you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Responsibilities&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Help Instagram acquire our next wave of new users and tap into new markets and demographics.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Enable Instagram to grow in a way that is incremental to the Family of Apps and expand our footprint, while maintaining a differentiated experience for our users.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have a solid understanding of emerging market growth and ensure that Instagram breaks into new territories, and better understand how users in emerging markets use Instagram differently.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minimum Qualification&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bachelors/Masters Degree with 4+ years (or PhD with 2+ years) of experience working within an analytical role&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;6+ years of experience with quantitative analysis&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience in an analytical role in a technology company, consulting, investment banking, or product management&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;5+ years experience with SQL or other programming languages&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience initiating and driving projects to completion with minimal guidance&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience communicating the results of analysis&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Preferred Qualification&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ph.D. in a quantitative discipline (e.g., statistics, mathematics, economics)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Understanding of statistical analysis, experience with packages, such as python, R, MATLAB, SPSS, SAS, Stata, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience working in a highly ambiguous field with evolving definitions and boundaries&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Facebook is proud to be an Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action employer.
