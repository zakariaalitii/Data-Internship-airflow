We make it super easy to sell (or buy) almost anything. We all have things we don\u2019t use, never used, or simply outgrew. But that stuff still has value. Mercari gives you the power to sell it, ship it, and earn some cash for it, simply and intuitively. Fashion to toys. Sporting goods to electronics. All the brands you know and love. Our mission is simple: to make selling as easy as buying. And with 50M+ downloads in the U.S. and 350k+ new listings every day, we're just getting started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the Software Engineer of the Growth Engineering team, you will be leading efforts to maximize the number of activated and engaged users. You will work with a team of product managers, engineers, and designers, owning the roadmap for your product and driving the team towards achieving their goals. You have a growth mindset where you live and breathe experimentation, data analysis, and ruthlessly prioritize for impact. You will launch initiatives to maintain and scale the growth engineering stack. You will improve metrics, analytics, and experimentation infrastructures. You are able to utilize your exceptional listening skills to curate opinions in pursuit of building the best experiences. Knowing that the best ideas are not always your own, you are extremely curious with an innate desire to learn. The Growth Engineering team operates with speed and agility, working on areas such as acquisition, activation, and engagement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you\u2019ll be doing&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be the subject matter expert in growth technology; understand our existing platform landscape and how to optimize it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Working alongside a small and collaborative team, white-boarding ideas, building new solutions as well as constantly improving experiences for Mercari customers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Inspire your cross-functional partners: product management, design, business intelligence, marketing, and research teams to achieve business objectives.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;be part of a technical team with a business mindset, figuring out how we can innovate to increase Mercari growth. As a growth engineer, you'll be able to see the impact of your code on the business.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lead new architecture and implementation work for customer-facing products and app experiences.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reviewing code and offering improvements to coding practices and processes to impact the larger organization.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you\u2019ll need:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Excellent engineer - you understand and advocate for testing, analytics, observability, error tolerance. You have significant front-end and/or back-end development experience using React and/or GoLang.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Growth mindset - Understand business KPIs and the end goal. Can challenge growth experiments, propose simpler implementation to fasten the iterations, can propose excellent technical decisions to improve user experience.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don\u2019t cry over lost code - This is someone who should be very comfortable with experimentation, knowing that a large amount of work won\u2019t make it into the final product.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be a self-starter - you are a confirmed developer who is able to show initiative and get things going without too much guidance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great communicator: comfortable working with teams with several functions - design, copywriting, data, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Excellent interpersonal skills. Ability to foster alignment and a sense of urgency.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Mercari?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mercari nurtures an all for one environment where teamwork and innovative thinking are the priority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=\"ql-cursor\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Perks:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Competitive medical, dental, and vision insurance options&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;401k match&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Life &amp;amp; disability insurance&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Employee Assistance Program&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;New parent paid leave&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rocket Lawyer legal services&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fond perks and rewards&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Time when you need it - unlimited vacation days&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "Mercari US", "sameAs": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/mercarius", "logo": "https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C560BAQGzZYBCdc3p8Q/company-logo_200_200/0/1625788019731?e=1638403200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=cgY3JtzzldJXrTlUBkhz258XgSdogjfYhfvjTaxaxgE"}, "identifier": {"@type": "PropertyValue", "name": "Mercari US"}, "image": "https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C560BAQGzZYBCdc3p8Q/company-logo_100_100/0/1625788019731?e=1638403200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=2c-Fm-SvH3bgGASRwGoklJ3AlSNIOxpOHcUsgWIfUag", "industry": "Internet", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "US", "addressLocality": "United States", "addressRegion": null, "postalCode": "99999", "streetAddress": null}, "latitude": 39.50355, "longitude": -99.0183}, "skills": "", "title": "Software Engineer, Growth Engineering", "validThrough": "2021-09-30T00:29:39.000Z", "educationRequirements": {"@type": "EducationalOccupationalCredential", "credentialCategory": "bachelor degree"}, "jobLocationType": "TELECOMMUTE", "applicantLocationRequirements": {"@type": "Country", "name": "United States"}}
