Tableau is as much a philosophy as an amazing suite of tools. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We enable people see and understand their data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, helping people make important decisions based on those insights. If you are passionate about technology, but also care deeply about doing something meaningful, Tableau is the place for you.
