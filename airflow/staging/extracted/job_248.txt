{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "JobPosting", "datePosted": "2021-06-14T03:27:00.000Z", "description": "The Applied AI Research team works on innovative solutions to solve practical real-world problems with direct impact on users of the OpenAI API . Powerful language models like GPT-3 excel at learning behavior patterns from the pre-training or fine-tuning datasets. Thus the quality and scale of the datasets will play a crucial role in any applications built on top of such models. We seek a Machine Learning Engineer to help design and build the pipelines to collect and manage high-quality data for various projects within Applied AI. Candidates for the Machine Learning Engineer, Data Quality role should have good engineering skills, industry experience in Machine Learning / Data Science, knowledge of processing a large amount of data in various formats and passion for building AI products.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In This Role You Will&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Design data pipelines, including finding appropriate data sources, scraping, filtering, post-processing, de-duplicating, and versioning. The system should be robust and scalable for production use.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Design and implement frameworks to evaluate the effectiveness of our models and data. For example, building an automated fine-tuning pipeline to compare the performances of different datasets or models on the same task.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Work closely with others who might be data contributors or consumers or both to incorporate their data usage needs on a variety of tasks and domains.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Work with our human labeling service to refine the procedure and guidelines to collect high-quality human annotation data.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Conduct open-ended research to improve the quality of collected data, including but not limited to, semi-supervised learning, human-in-the-loop machine learning and fine-tuning with human feedback.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Enjoy This Role If You&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have 3+ years industry experience as a Data Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer, or Data Scientist, dealing with large amounts of data on a daily basis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are goal-oriented, passionate about building cutting-edge AI products and solving real-world problems from our API developers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have a strong belief in the criticality of high-quality data and are highly motivated to work with the associated challenges.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Enjoy taking ownership while working with others to understand their needs. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Care about code quality and enjoy building tools that can be used by many others.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have experience working in large distributed systems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Love working with a team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About OpenAI&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;We\u2019re building safe Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), and ensuring it leads to a good outcome for humans.
