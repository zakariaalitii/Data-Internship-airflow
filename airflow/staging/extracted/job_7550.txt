Our offering addresses cradle to grave management of device fleets, wellness monitoring, software management, cloud integration and advanced workflow automation and orchestration. Beyond the foundational aspects of device management, EdgeIQ also provides rich services to consume, understand, analyze and federate the valuable data that devices produce. While many companies may attempt to build modern provisioning and software update tools, EdgeIQ knows that connected products are more than networked devices. Connected products are the very essence of our customers\u2019 business and of their customers\u2019 operations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, 50,000 businesses build their own DeviceOps software - draining billions of dollars from their most important mission of building innovative products, delighting customers and serving shareholders. We are on our way to building a $100M+ business that offers limitless financial and professional value to our entire team.&amp;nbsp; We have already secured six-figure ARR contracts with several Fortune 100 companies and have rich partnerships with leading technology companies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Culturally, we are a mission-based, problem-driven organization solving complex and essential business challenges.

We know who our customers are, we have a brilliantly simple solution that can be applied to limitless environments and create trillions of dollars of value for our customers and their customers..&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are in search of new team members and leaders who are hungry and ready to embrace the mission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This newest member of our team is responsible for applying their experience in building and supporting highly available, scalable, industrial strength systems to deliver on EdgeIQ\u2019s mission of leading a DeviceOps category and saving tens of thousands of companies billions of dollars.
