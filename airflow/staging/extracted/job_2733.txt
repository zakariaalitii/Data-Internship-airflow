To design. To code. To consult. To think along with clients and sell. To make markets. To invent. To collaborate. Not just to do something better, but to attempt things you've never thought possible. Are you ready to lead in this new era of technology and solve some of the world's most challenging problems? If so, lets talk.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your Role and Responsibilities&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;We\u2019re looking for a Site Reliability Engineer to join us at IBM.

We approach this as a software problem instead of as an operations problem. Applying software engineering practices to hosting and managing enables our services to better adapt to all types of changes and failure scenarios. To help us accomplish this approach we use the latest techniques, practices and technology from the industry while hosting large-scale mission critical infrastructure. Some of the techniques, practices, and technologies we use are Docker, IaaS, PaaS, ChatOps, Continuous Delivery, Continuous Deployment, DevOps, and Immutable Infrastructure. We strive to keep learning and improving, and we work to share the knowledge we have learned throughout IBM.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our project is a highly visible connectivity layer between IBM and the Cloud, used by many groups and service providers in IBM to connect their internal and cloud-based assets and users.
