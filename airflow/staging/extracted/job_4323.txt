These are the people who power the App Store, Apple TV, Apple Music, Apple Podcasts, and Apple Books.

They develop the custom software used to process all the creative work, the tools that providers use to deliver that media, all the server-side systems, and the APIs for many Apple services.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks to Apple\u2019s unique integration of hardware, software, and services, engineers here partner to get behind a single unified vision. That vision always includes a deep commitment to strengthening Apple\u2019s privacy policy, one of Apple\u2019s core values. Although services are a bigger part of Apple\u2019s business than ever before, these teams remain small, forward-thinking, and cross-functional, offering greater exposure to the array of opportunities here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Qualifications&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;At least 5 years in a Reliability Engineering, DevOps or infrastructure focused role &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Passion for designing and building reliable systems&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Advanced experience with programming languages (GoLang, Python, Java, C++)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Deep systems and infrastructure knowledge&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Automation advocate - you truly believe in removing operation load with software&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Experience with deploying, supporting and monitoring new and existing services, platforms, and application stacks&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Excellent troubleshooting and problem solving skills&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Experience with scale testing, disaster recovery, and capacity planning&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Familiarity with microservices architecture and container orchestration with Kubernetes&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Demonstrated ability to deliver results on time with high quality&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;Apple Media Content SRE is responsible for designing, building and running a diverse set of services that ingest, transform and manage all media content across products like the App Store, Apple Music and, Apple TV+.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Whether it\u2019s the latest episode of the Morning Show, a new album from your favorite artist or a brand new iOS app destined for the App Store you will make sure our systems are highly available, fast and efficient.
