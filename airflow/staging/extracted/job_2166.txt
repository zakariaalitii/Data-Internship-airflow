By joining an organization that values a supportive, inclusive, and flexible work environment, you\u2019ll have the opportunity to engage through our eight employee resource groups, numerous employee-driven clubs, and learning and professional development classes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;NREL supports inclusive, diverse, and unbiased hiring practices that promote creativity and innovation. By collaborating with organizations that focus on diverse talent pools, reaching out to underrepresented demographics, and providing an inclusive application and interview process, our Talent Acquisition team aims to hear all voices equally. We strive to attract a highly diverse workforce and create a culture where every employee feels welcomed and respected and they can be their authentic selves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Job Description&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The Complex Systems Simulation and Optimization Group in the NREL Computational Science Center has an opening for a full-time Researcher - Applied Mathematics, with emphasis on stochastic programming, infrastructure planning, extreme event modelling, and scenario creation leveraging large data sets and high-performance computing. As penetrations of renewable energy resources on power grids increase, it has become imperative to leverage algorithms capable of making operational and expansion decisions in the presence of uncertainty. Furthermore, such algorithms are enabled by the use of high-fidelity data sets to characterize uncertainty and variability. We are looking for a dynamic researcher with a strong technical background with and experience in the interactions between large resource data sets and optimization under uncertainty to support multiple projects at NREL and energy system resilience.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Domain Areas Of Interest Include&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The successful candidate will collaborate to develop, adapt, and improve cutting edge stochastic programming methods that use flagship NREL datasets and software and apply the resulting tools to real world projects in support of NREL and EERE mission and goals. The candidate will be tasked with core understanding of the mathematical formulations of these algorithms and how to supply users with high-fidelity renewable energy resource data.&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Electric grid operations, planning and resilience: the candidate will couple NREL software and datasets with algorithms for decision making under uncertainty to enable the operation and planning of future power grids with higher penetrations of renewable energy resources. This will require knowledge of optimal power flow formulations, capacity and transmission expansion, security constraints, and stochastic scenarios for renewable energy production.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Optimization under uncertainty: the candidate will leverage existing optimization solvers and software packages for solving optimization problems. Understanding of both how to use optimization software and the underlying mathematics are required. Examples of software used for these problems include JuMP and Pyomo, and solvers used include Gurobi.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;NREL software and datasets at scale: reV, SAM, and the WIND Toolkit are used to inform operational and infrastructure expansion decisions under uncertainty targeting deployment on high performance computing systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Responsibilities&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Conduct independent and collaborative research in developing and using advanced applied mathematics, modeling and simulation for energy systems research.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Exascale computing: Collaborate with domain experts to identify where optimization under uncertainty coupled with high-fidelity scenarios constitutes a viable approach, and identify the needed math, computing, and simulation tools required to implement and evaluate the performance of optimization code. Maintain awareness of the state-of-the art in optimization under uncertainty as it pertains to NREL and EERE mission and goals. Help to establish and streamline optimization under uncertainty workflows on both user laptops and HPC systems. Author publications and contribute to proposals to sustain research directions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Electric Grid: Identify typical optimization problems regarding power grid operations, infrastructure expansion, and resiliency. Develop corresponding mathematical, simulation, and computational frameworks. Conduct algorithmic development for data-driven scenario and security constraint generation. Quantify the impacts of destructive rare events, for example hurricanes, on power grids.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leverage NREL software and data sets, such as reV, SAM, and the WIND Toolkit to build high-fidelity uncertainty sets for use in electric grid operation and expansion problems requiring optimization under uncertainty. Provide feedback to software and data set developers on usage of their products and collaborate to iteratively evaluate, improve, and refine NREL data sets and software, thus supporting the transition to clean energy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience quantifying the uncertainty of NREL\u2019s Wind Integration National Data Toolset using HPC systems for data processing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience using the GridMod/RTS-GMLC dataset and the Texas A&amp;amp;M University Electric Grid Datasets and creating renewables generation datasets for these systems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience using the geopandas, Renewable Energy Potential Model (reV), NREL system advisor model (SAM), and the FEMA HAZUS analysis tool.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience using optimization models to solve two-stage stochastic optimization problems under uncertainty in renewable energy generation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Basic Qualifications &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Relevant PhD .
