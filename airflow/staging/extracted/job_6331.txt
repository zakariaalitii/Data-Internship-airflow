With over 10 years of experience in the post-production world, our founders have worked with hundreds of studios that face the same problems because they are locked into physical infrastructure and outdated workflows. At Suite, we are creating a highly intelligent platform built from small, distributed, and composable pieces of functionality that come together to provide a revolutionary service for post-production - and we\u2019re looking for amazing people to help us build it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are a team that prioritizes people, recognizing that diverse backgrounds and a healthy work-life balance produce the best results. We communicate openly, ensuring ideas and feedback are shared early and often. Our team succeeds together, encouraging one another to be our best by offering support when it's needed and celebrating our wins together. Most importantly, our team loves what they do and has fun doing it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your Story&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are a highly motivated individual who carries a \"think like an owner\" mentality.
