We are a growing startup in Washington, DC, running a cloud-native, machine learning-empowered Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platform. Our clients range from small regional financial institutions to multi-national corporations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Data Science team at Adlumin collaborates with a team of engineers to automate the ingestion of security logs into the cloud and builds machine learning solutions for empowering IT security. These applications have immediate impact on Adlumin clients, boosting their ability to effectively monitor billions of log messages through online model scoring and highly informative alerts on events that warrant further investigation. You will be joining a team of data scientists committed to cutting-edge research in anomaly detection. The general use case is relatively new and therefore offers the opportunity to write breakthrough algorithms using unsupervised modeling techniques on a wide range of data types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THIS IS NOT A REMOTE POSITION - CANDIDATES MUST RESIDE IN OR BE RELOCATING TO THE WASHINGTON, DC METRO AREA AND MUST BE U.S. CITIZENS;
