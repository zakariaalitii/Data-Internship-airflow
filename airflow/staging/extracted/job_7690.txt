He was thrust into file systems early in his career at Inktomi and then learned the true meaning of scalability while working on Gmail and Colossus at Google. Before stepping into the office in the morning, he will have nursed his CrossFit addiction and dealt with the chaos of a three kid morning routine. You can set your watch by his daily departure at 4:30 pm to have dinner with his family.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Isaac Wong - VP of Engineering&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Isaac is responsible for the health of the engineering organization at Cockroach Labs.

Before joining Cockroach Labs Isaac was in life sciences for 16 years with Medidata Solutions where he had a front row seat on the exciting ride from a 30 person startup to more than 2000 people worldwide. But the lure of distributed, resilient, and consistent SQL databases, along with the amazing technology and culture at Cockroach Labs proved too much. When not working he likes to draw, play the piano, and search NYC for cannoli's with his wife and kids&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our Benefits&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;100% health insurance coverage (for you and your dependents!)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fertility and Family Planning coverage&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Paid parental leave (with baby bucks)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Flex Fridays&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Flexible time off &amp;amp; flexible hours&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Education reimbursement&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Relocation support&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Cockroach Labs is proud to be an Equal Opportunity Employer building a diverse and inclusive workforce.
