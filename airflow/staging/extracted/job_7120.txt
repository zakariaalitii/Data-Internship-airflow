People feel lost in the system today and healthcare employees are essentially working in the dark due to outdated technology that creates a lack of shared knowledge and siloed data. Olive is designed to drive connections, shining a new light on the broken healthcare processes that stand between providers and patient care. She uses AI to reveal life-changing insights that make healthcare more efficient, affordable and effective. Olive\u2019s vision is to unleash a trillion dollars of hidden potential within healthcare by connecting its disconnected systems. Olive is improving healthcare operations today, so everyone can benefit from a healthier industry tomorrow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Olive Helps is healthcare\u2019s AI\u2011powered sidekick, making the healthcare ecosystem more efficient. Through a lightweight desktop application, Olive Helps delivers real-time information to healthcare workers, and she drives them directly to the task-specific intelligence they need. Olive Helps healthcare workers get the information they need via Loops in the Loop Library (think apps in an app store). And with more partners creating Loops every day, the impact she can have on our human workforce is endless.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Job Overview&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;We are looking for a Staff Engineer to work with the teams that are changing the way every developer in the country can participate in fixing and improving healthcare.
