CHLA is the only children's hospital in California to make the prestigious U.S. News &amp;amp; World Report Honor Roll of \"Best\" children's hospitals, and is nationally ranked in all 10 pediatric specialties.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Join a hospital where the work you do will matter\u2014to you, to your colleagues, and above all, to our patients and families. At times the work may be challenging, but it is always rewarding. We hope you\u2019ll come and find out for yourself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It\u2019s &lt;em&gt;Work That Matters&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The CHLA Pathology Laboratory Medicine (PLM) seeks a highly motivated and talented bioinformatics scientist with a strong background in genomics, bioinformatics, and data analytics to address informatics needs of PLM. Fifty percent of the effort will be dedicated to CHLA\u2019s recently awarded funded project (more than $2 million dollars over three years) by the Governor\u2019s Office of the State of California (https://opr.ca.gov/ciapm/activity/research/aces/awardees.html). This funded project aims to enhance early Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) screening by combining a questionnaire with innovative molecular and genomics-based tests that detect mitochondrial dysfunction, a key indicator of toxic stress. This work will be performed under the guidance of the Director of Bioinformatics at CHLA Center for Personalized Medicine (CPM). This project is also to leverage Dr. Xiaowu Gai\u2019s field-leading expertise in mitochondrial genetics, genomics and bioinformatics. The other fifty percent effort will involve developing bioinformatics and statistical analyses on the clinical and translational research data sets including but not limited to genomics assays, transcriptomics, spatial genomics, metagenomics, pathology laboratory results, and other clinical metadata for early disease detection and discovery of the contributing genetic and environmental factors. This work will be performed under the guidance of the Director for CHLA\u2019s Center for Pathology Informatics and Data Science.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This bioinformatics scientist will work as part of a large and well established (CLIA-certified) genomic medicine, anatomic pathology, and laboratory medicine divisions of the CHLA\u2019s PLM. This is a rare opportunity for a bioinformatician to work directly on clinical datasets across the divisions of pathology. This will present ample opportunities to develop novel informatics methods for comprehensive understanding of pathology of various diseases. Thus, will be extremely beneficial for future career development.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Candidates should have a PhD or Master\u2019s degree in computer science, systems biology, molecular biology, genetics/genomics, bioinformatics, and/or related field with good analytical experience. The successful candidate will have strong computer (i.e. LINUX/UNIX) and programming skills (e.g. python, C/C++, Bash, Perl), as well as data analysis (e.g. R, python, MATLAB). Excellent written and verbal communication skills are required.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minimum Qualifications&lt;/strong&gt;: Education qualifications - doctoral (preferred) or Master\u2019s degree.
