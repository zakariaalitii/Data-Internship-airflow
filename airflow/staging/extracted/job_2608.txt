We know that new ideas can come from anywhere in the organization, and the next big idea could be yours!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What Are We Doing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting a company has become easier, but growing a company is more complicated than ever.

Redundant, resistant and secure.&amp;nbsp;And accuracy is key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is your opportunity to be an early engineer at a well funded startup that has a successful founder and a drive to change how company's leverage their financials.
