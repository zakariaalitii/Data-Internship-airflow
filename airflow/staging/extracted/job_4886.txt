See, while we know you're awesome, it's actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of literally hundreds of other applications we get from everyone else. So this is where we're going to ask our first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so we don't accidentally overlook you? There are many ways to do that, but the easiest way to help us out is by answering the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;What's the URL of your website? If you don't have one, why not?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What's your admin/coding history? When did you start, and what have you done between then and now?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What do you want to do with the rest of your life, and how is Expensify a step toward your long-term goals?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How did you hear about us? A job posting? Chalk on a sidewalk? From a friend? Let us know where you saw this opening.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resume not your thing? That\u2019s great, we don\u2019t really read them anyway! Forward your responses to the questions to apply@expensify.com.
