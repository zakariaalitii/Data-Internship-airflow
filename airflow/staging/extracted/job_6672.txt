As our offices re-open, Atlassians can choose to work remotely or return to an office, unless it\u2019s necessary for the role to be performed in the office. Interviews and onboarding are conducted virtually, a part of being a distributed-first company. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;As a Site Reliability Engineer at Trello, you\u2019ll work on keeping everything running efficiently as we scale our infrastructure from supporting over 35 million Trello users today towards our goal of 100 million users and maintaining our target of 99.99% uptime.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Key Responsibilities&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Owning the infrastructure and pragmatically solving problems dealing with complex systems&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Working with developers to support the latest features in development, like Power-Ups, data pipeline improvements, and scalable microservices&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Contributing your insights across the team to help us improve or re-architect existing systems for scale and extensibility&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Contributing to new and existing compliance initiatives&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;More About You&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;You've been in the trenches building highly scalable, efficient, and resilient systems&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You prefer lasting solutions, yet know the time and place for a quick hack&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You're excited about scaling the platform using technologies in our stack like MongoDB, Kafka, ElasticSearch, and Redis to handle massive quantities of data and users&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You\u2019re comfortable deploying and monitoring the systems that you\u2019ve built with tools like puppet, terraform, and nagios&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You\u2019re a fast learner and can contribute from day one&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You have an excellent command of written and spoken English&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;More About Our Team&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Our engineers and designers run the show with management existing to support, not dictate.

We use Ubuntu, Puppet, Terraform, Nagios, Python, and Fabric to tie it all together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;More About Our Benefits&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Whether you work in an office or a distributed team, Atlassian is highly collaborative and yes, fun!
