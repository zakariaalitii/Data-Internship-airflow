Our shared mission is to challenge the inevitability of genetic disease by discovering, developing, and delivering treatments in ways unimaginable \u2013 until now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We don\u2019t follow footsteps. We create the path.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Liver Translational R&amp;amp;D team designs and engineers breakthrough therapies that harness the power of the liver as a platform for production and systemic distribution of therapeutics. The Senior Research Scientist on the Liver R&amp;amp;D Team leads a pre-clinical pipeline from identification lead candidates through proof of concept and IND-enabling studies. She/he will lead efforts in assay development, perform data analysis independently, and communicate scientific findings to executive leadership. In addition, the Senior Scientist serves as a subject matter expert to support cross-functional research efforts across the Translational R&amp;amp;D Department.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;He/she Will Be Responsible For&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; Developing strategies to optimize potency and efficacy of gene therapy vectors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Creating novel approaches to enhance specificity, regulatability, and durability of gene therapy vectors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Design and support in vivo studies to assess the efficacy and safety of lead candidate therapeutics.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Analyze and summarize experimental findings in the form of study reports, peer-reviewed manuscripts, and oral/poster presentations at scientific meetings.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Initiate and manage external research collaborations with contract research organizations and academic investigators in a diverse array of scientific disciplines.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Mentor and train Research Scientists and Research Associates on the Liver Team.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Leverage orthogonal datasets to synthesize new insights into biomarkers and signaling dynamics relevant to measuring therapeutic efficacy or providing new treatment modalities for target diseases.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Responsibilities&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;70%&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Identify and validate new indication targets and optimize gene expression cassettes to support both existing and new programs in the pipeline. This includes executing experiments on the bench, extensive literature review, championing product candidate development from proof of concept to IND submission, etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;15%&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Design experiments, organize, discuss, and record experimental data&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;10%&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Generate technical reports, prepare presentation slides, generate novel concepts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;5%&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trainings, lab meetings and administration work&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Requirements&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; A degree in the life sciences in a relevant field such as molecular biology, cell biology, biochemistry, or genetics/genomics w/ 3-5 years of related experience required. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; 3 to 5 years of post-degree research experience.
