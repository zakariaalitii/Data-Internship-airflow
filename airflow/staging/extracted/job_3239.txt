Our vision is to revolutionise 3D design and the way products are brought to life. We are developing the first 3D digital design platform focused on creative designers. We aim to positively disrupt the current design and engineering workflows, placing the user at the center of the creation process in hopes of accelerating the full development process. The platform is used by thousands of designers across the globe in industries such as transportation, industrial design, media and entertainment, and apparel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Life At Gravity Sketch&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;We\u2019re a small team of 33. We move quickly, take pride and ownership in our work, and aim to leave a real impact on the industry. Our culture is one of innovation, collaboration, and creativity. We\u2019re looking for ambitious, passionate, and empathetic people who want to join us on our journey. As a fast-growing start-up we\u2019re process-light and with a heavy focus on innovating. If you\u2019re resourceful by nature and a great team player, you\u2019ll fit right in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At Gravity Sketch, you\u2019ll drive your own projects and career development.

We\u2019re always open to trying new things if you want to share your hobby with the team!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What You'll Be Doing&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;This role will involve designing and developing large scale distributed systems to support real-time multi-user interactions in an Immersive Product (yes, even more complex than an MMO), with 3D collaboration.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a Backend Engineer in an immersive technology company, you will need to understand our products and have empathy with our users. You must have a passion and motivation to improve, propose, design, and develop scalable backend systems to support low latency interactions across multi-platform applications such as desktop, mobile devices, design tablets, AR, VR and so on. You\u2019ll work on PoC, MVP, and production development, and properly address and balance the quality (scalability, reliability, extensibility, flexibility etc) of the systems you are going to deliver within set timeframes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The role would suit someone with a solid engineering foundation, and strong motivation to learn new skills and knowledge in cutting edge technologies. Ideally you\u2019re always willing to try, propose, redesign, and refactor alternative solutions to be more efficient, while reducing errors, and minimising human interactions for easier maintenance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Requirements&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we look for&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Compatible to work within Pacific timezone (this is a fully remote role)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bachelor\u2019s degree in fields related to Computer Science, Physics, Mathematics, or Engineering&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Development experience in at least one of the languages C#, C++, Java, Golang, Rust&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Understand and adopt rigorous industry-standard coding and design pattern best practices, including SOLID&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience with distributed system(s)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strong understanding of distributed database(s)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keen interest in continuously learning new and emerging technologies&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Willing to get hands on with devops&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonus points if you have&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience in large scale projects and working as part of a team&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience with a large scale distributed system&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience using Redis, Apache Cassandra, DynamoDB, ElasticSearch, Docker, Kubernetes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Understand concurrency, high-multi threading and low latency interactions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Understand and know how to build a scalable system&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience deploying to AWS or Google cloud&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;React, Javascript, HTML, or other frontend development experience&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Medical, dental &amp;amp; vision insurance &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;25 days paid holiday&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Employee stock options&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;\u00a31,000 personal budget per year for professional development&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Enhanced parental leave policy (maternity and paternity)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Top spec IT equipment&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Regular team socials, team lunches&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chance to work at a fast growing startup disrupting the Createch industry&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Real work ownership - you drive your own initiatives&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great work culture and environment - we work hard but also know how to have fun&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;em&gt;We are committed to equality of opportunity for all employees.
