We strive to understand our customers\u2019 intent and identify relevant ads which enable them to discover new and alternate products. This also enables sellers on Amazon to showcase their products to customers, which may at times be buried deeper in the search results.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our systems and algorithms operate on one of the world's largest product catalogs, matching shoppers with products - with a high relevance bar and strict latency constraints. We are a team of machine learning scientists and software engineers working on complex solutions to understand the customer intent and present them with ads that are not only relevant to their actual shopping experience, but also non-obtrusive. This area is of strategic importance to Amazon Retail and Marketplace business, driving long term-growth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are looking for a Software Engineer (ML), who can drive appropriate technology choices for the business. You will build services to handle billions of requests per day, while maintaining response latencies in milliseconds and meeting strict SLA requirements. It is quite routine for our systems to operate on massive datasets using distributed frameworks. You will design and code, troubleshoot, and support high volume and low latency distributed systems. The solutions you create would drive step increases in coverage of sponsored ads across the retail website and ensure relevant ads are served to Amazon's customers. You will directly impact our customers\u2019 shopping experience while helping our sellers get the maximum ROI from advertising on Amazon. This role will provide exposure to cutting-edge innovations in product search, information retrieval, natural language processing (NLP), deep learning, and image processing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Basic Qualifications&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; Programming experience with at least one modern language such as Java, C++, or C# including object-oriented design&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Bachelor's degree in computer science related fields OR 1+ years equivalent experience in software development&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Preferred Qualifications&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; Industry experience in software development.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Experience with machine learning in production&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Experience with Big Data technologies such as AWS, Hadoop, Spark, Pig, Hive, Pig, Hive, Presto, HBase, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Excellent software systems design expereince&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Experience with ML libraries/frameworks such as Tensorflow, AWS Sagemaker, Keras, PyTorch, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Coursework or thesis in machine learning, data mining, information retrieval, statistics or natural language processing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Advanced knowledge of performance, scalability, enterprise system architecture, and engineering best practices&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Company&lt;/strong&gt; - Amazon.com Services LLC&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Job ID: A1688927", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "Amazon", "sameAs": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/amazon", "logo": "https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C560BAQHTvZwCx4p2Qg/company-logo_200_200/0/1612205615891?e=1637798400&amp;v=beta&amp;t=IzviOT0N5XdMGTc-LLvc6fnNsvwFIeKB_J6DF-DXeTM"}, "identifier": {"@type": "PropertyValue", "name": "Amazon", "value": "1688927"}, "image": "https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C560BAQHTvZwCx4p2Qg/company-logo_100_100/0/1612205615891?e=1637798400&amp;v=beta&amp;t=puPWnyZu9b2sTNU_4LeVl8mf-mQFpUJwN9wFTSj6GmI", "industry": "Computer Software,Information Technology and Services,Internet", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "US", "addressLocality": "New York", "addressRegion": "NY", "postalCode": "10132", "streetAddress": null}, "latitude": 40.713047, "longitude": -74.00723}, "skills": "", "title": "Machine Learning Engineer", "validThrough": "2021-09-23T00:42:01.000Z", "educationRequirements": {"@type": "EducationalOccupationalCredential", "credentialCategory": "bachelor degree"}, "experienceRequirements": {"@type": "OccupationalExperienceRequirements", "monthsOfExperience": 12}, "estimatedSalary": {"@type": "MonetaryAmount", "currency": "USD", "value": {"@type": "QuantitativeValue", "minValue": 65300, "maxValue": 101000, "unitText": "YEAR"}}}
