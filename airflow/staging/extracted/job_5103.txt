{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "JobPosting", "datePosted": "2021-08-20T21:14:40.000Z", "description": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Cheetah&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Restaurants and small businesses account for hundreds of billions of dollars in annual &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;purchasing, yet most of it happens offline. From the humblest NYC slice and a cup of &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;joe to museum-quality lattes (and yes, avocado toast), each order represents a long &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;paper trail and a series of truck deliveries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a rapidly growing market presence, Cheetah is already streamlining the daily &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;workflow of hundreds of restaurants and small business owners. Using Cheetah\u2019s &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;services, they manage millions of dollars in monthly purchasing, while Cheetah &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;eliminates the burden of costly sales reps and inflexible, inefficient distribution centers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partnering with the largest suppliers in the US, Cheetah is bringing the Silicon Valley &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;user experience to an industry that hasn\u2019t evolved in decades. In the process, we\u2019re &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;helping to reintroduce the small business owner to the small farmer, global supply &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;chains to familiar faces, and delivery and logistics workers to increased mobility and &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;new opportunities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Cheetah, a relentless executive team has set out to change this reality, armed with &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;deep industry and entrepreneurial experience, personal conviction, and $70M in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;funding from Eclipse, Floodgate, and the early backers of Facebook, Lyft and Airbnb. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unencumbered by the old-school business models and practices, Cheetah has &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;introduced unprecedented transparency in pricing and inventory to the SMB &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;marketplace. In doing so, Cheetah allows the people who form the backbone of local &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;economies to focus on what they love: cooking great food and providing excellent &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;service. From the convenience of their phones, business owners can now order &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;whatever they need, discover new, rare or seasonal specialty products, and prioritize &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;their customers. No more rushing to unload your double-parked van, or waiting &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;anxiously for a truck to show up with your weekly allotment of boxes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Scientist (Operations)&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheetah is looking for a data scientist with experience designing and optimizing &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;logistics and warehouse operations. This function is vital to the long-term success of &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;the company and ensures that Cheetah warehouses are operating in an efficient way &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;and customers receive their deliveries at the optimal time and freshness, while also &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;minimizing operation / transportation costs. In this role, you will have the chance to &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;redefine how restaurants and small businesses receive the supplies they need to run &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;their organizations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this role you must be driven to understand complex problems and find unique, out- &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;of-the-box solutions. For example, you will be responsible for building and &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;implementing the models that predict the transit and service time of each delivery, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;optimize transportation cost, and inform the product team on which new customer &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;facing features (e.g. delivery windows) to create. We want someone who loves &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;modeling and writing code, diving into difficult problems and creating exceptional &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;automated systems. This individual will work with the engineering team to deploy and &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;evaluate model testing, and generate other hypothesis based experiments. You will &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;define, measure and utilize metrics to build business cases and present them to your &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;team and senior management. This role will be an integral part of the data team and &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;will ensure Cheetah provides customers with an unparallelled delivery experience by &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;using data mining, mathematical and statistical modeling, and machine learning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Define and collect relevant data to perform further analyses on logistics and warehouse operations. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Develop, implement and optimize algorithms for Cheetah daily operations, such as: (1) Warehouse slot allocation and pick path optimization; (2) Product assortment and vendor type selection among regular-stocked, Just-In-Time, dropship, and consignment vendors; (3) Inventory outbound / inbound and labour scheduling; (4) Fleet assignment and routing optimization (including backhauls); and (5) Dynamic delivery windows selections. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Work with the engineering team to build processes to support fast, iterative experimentation - both for model creation and product development. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Collaborate with business intelligence teams to develop reports and visualization dashboards. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Build financial models to project key business metrics - on-time deliveries, cost per drop, error in delivery predictions - and develop KPIs to track performance. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Qualifications:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;3+ years of professional experience with machine learning, predictive modeling,&amp;nbsp;and optimization techniques, handling large, complex, data sets. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;MS or PhD in a quantitative field such as Industrial Engineering, Operations Research, Computer Science, or a related Engineering degree. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Proven track record in solving business problems through fact based, scientific, methods. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience in Python /  R, SQL, and similar languages to manipulate and transform data into insights, as well as developing algorithms for deployment to production systems. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Deep understanding of linear / non-linear optimization, simulation, machine learning, and statistical analyses. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strong verbal, writing, and presentation skills, as well as the ability to persuade, inspire, and motivate others. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Must have the ability to summarize key insights for both technical and non-technical audiences. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;enefits and Perks&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Flexible working schedule / location &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Company happy hours, team building events, and intramural sports teams &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unlimited paid time off &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Comprehensive medical/dental/vision insurance and commuter benefits &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;401(kplan and flexible spending benefits &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The opportunity to work alongside a visionary team during Cheetah\u2019s rapid &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;growth!&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "Cheetah", "sameAs": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/gocheetah", "logo": "https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C560BAQGMuIm2Pz8gAg/company-logo_200_200/0/1591197581104?e=1637798400&amp;v=beta&amp;t=9S_DLtLZa1RjlRoy3aCGWwfC-dWwNiEaU9YhwSqdcSU"}, "identifier": {"@type": "PropertyValue", "name": "Cheetah"}, "image": "https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C560BAQGMuIm2Pz8gAg/company-logo_100_100/0/1591197581104?e=1637798400&amp;v=beta&amp;t=FZzaG-9WEJhk50ncKJmUTyFzKLF5gsYG8VI3sZBA7Og", "industry": "", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "US", "addressLocality": "Pleasanton", "addressRegion": "CA", "postalCode": "94588", "streetAddress": null}, "latitude": 37.658436, "longitude": -121.877}, "skills": "", "title": "Data Scientist - Operations", "validThrough": "2022-02-16T21:13:35.000Z", "educationRequirements": {"@type": "EducationalOccupationalCredential", "credentialCategory": "bachelor degree"}, "experienceRequirements": {"@type": "OccupationalExperienceRequirements", "monthsOfExperience": 36}}
