As part of Microsoft\u2019s Cloud + AI Group, we are responsible for building, managing, and securing the platform, products, processes, and services that powers Microsoft. We build, maintain, and implement a cloud-first approach to our technology and experiences, from custom-built business solutions developing our campus of the future and our productivity and collaboration experiences like Teams and SharePoint, to horizontal 3rd party solutions like SAP and Adobe. As a steward of Microsoft and our customer\u2019s data, a core function of Microsoft Digital is ensuring the security of every aspect of the business. Microsoft Digital is responsible for company-wide information security and compliance, with a strategic focus on information protection, assessment, awareness, governance, and enterprise business continuity. Microsoft Digital\u2019s charter is also to influence and work alongside engineers across the company and with strategic partners to build and grow their cloud products and services. As customer zero, we deploy these services inside Microsoft and then share best practices with enterprise customers at scale across the globe. We have exciting opportunities for you to innovate, influence, transform, inspire and grow within our organization and we encourage you to apply to learn more!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Microsoft has been a leading company in computing for decades. We are a global company, relied on by companies, governments, utilities, stores, schools, universities and co-operatives to deliver the things they need to work, every day. In order to make this work, we need to make it reliable. In order to make it reliable, we need you -- someone who already is, or is interested in becoming, a Site Reliability Engineer (also known as SRE), within our SAS Site Reliability Engineering team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) team provides leadership, direction and accountability for application architecture, system design, and end-to-end implementation. As a Site Reliability Engineer, you will identify and deliver service improvements using your expertise in services engineering, systems, networks and software know-how, reliability and dependency analysis and scalable system design principles. Strong collaboration skills will be required to work closely with other engineering teams, service owners and support teams to ensure services/systems are highly stable and performant, meeting the expectations of our user base across the company.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Site Reliability Engineering is a hybrid role, comparatively rare in industry but crucially important to how things work behind the scenes today. SREs are people who take engineering-based approaches to solving operations problems; we like infrastructure, we like seeing how the big complicated thing works, and most importantly, we gain great satisfaction from making it better.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our Site Reliability engineers are persistent problem solvers, always focused on mitigating issues and owning a problem until resolution is in place. To accomplish this, they work in close collaboration with various engineering teams.

Creativity and data-driven decision making is heavily valued in this emerging role.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Site Reliability Engineers build, monitor, and maintain the systems and infrastructure that ensure our customers can quickly access their data and run workloads whenever they need to. We identify service problems and areas for improvement, and we help implement solutions.
