These teams should be spending time with people, but unfortunately all facets of People teams are bogged down by managing processes instead of helping people. That\u2019s where Sora comes in: we\u2019re building a product that streamlines the tedious and repetitive work People teams do every day, from sending emails to assigning onboarding tasks to a new hire\u2019s manager to syncing data across anywhere from 3 to 20 tools in a customer\u2019s HR stack.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We\u2019re a pure startup, with all the excitement that carries as a foundational member, but with more thoughtfulness than the typical early-stage company. We\u2019re committed to our values and we take our mission seriously. Employee experience is in our DNA \u2014 we invest in processes that are inclusive and fair, and we invest in our long-term mental, physical, and emotional health.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sora was founded in late 2018 and launched in 2020. We\u2019ve fundraised from some of the best investors in the world and prioritize keeping a diverse group of investors and advisors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sora is committed to being a diverse, equitable, and inclusive workplace. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, age, physical disability, or length of time spent unemployed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your team&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;We are a small and mighty team of engineers with a passion for helping People teams do their best work. We\u2019re empathetic, scrappy, nimble, thoughtful and committed to excellence. We listen to our teammates when they raise ideas or concerns. We regularly provide guidance that shapes which features we prioritize as a company, and then we drive the planning, implementation, and release of those features.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We live all over the country and (respective of COVID) love to get together for board games, surfing, cooking, Mario Kart, and more :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As you grow in your career, you'll be supported by a handful of other senior+ engineers who work in a company culture that rewards collaboration. You'll learn from some of the best!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your role&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;You'll develop and ship frontend and backend features that enable our customers to keep their employee data in sync across the 3rd party tools they use, build Sora product tools on top of that data, and help keep our application bug- and jank-free.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are an extremely customer-focused company, so you'll get first-hand exposure to learning a prioritization process that truly values customer needs. You'll build and employ an array of skills that enable you to engage customers to help them get what they need out of Sora, keeping security and best practices top of mind. If you're looking for a starter role that gets you exposure to wearing a lot of hats in a small and energetic environment, you'll love this job.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You\u2019ll be a driver for positive change to Sora's engineering culture, processes and technology. Importantly, you'll help shape the future of the engineering organization and culture of the entire company!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Experiences in these areas is not required, but in case it\u2019s interesting, the main pieces of our stack include:&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Node&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;React&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Postgres&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Redis&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;AWS&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;What we do look for is examples of rolling up your sleeves to get the job done, being able to solve problems you hadn't encountered before, and despite the awareness of challenges, a desire to always push yourself to be better.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please feel free to reach out to careers@sora.co with any questions at all.
