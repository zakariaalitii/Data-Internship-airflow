I don\u2019t have a particular management style per say but I think candor, empathy and transparency goes a long way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Additional Information&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;PayScale provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, national origin, age, disability, genetic information, marital status, amnesty, or status as a covered veteran in accordance with applicable federal, state and local laws.
