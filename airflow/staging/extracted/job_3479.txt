Our technology enables suppliers and buyers to safely and effortlessly transact their materials at the push of a button. In addition to connecting suppliers and buyers we also handle global logistics, financing, and quality control! As a company, we believe in delivering an amazing customer experience and doing good for the environment by promoting recycling. On the latter, the proof is in the facts: recycling 1 ton of material is the equivalent to reducing the greenhouse gas emissions of more than 7,000 miles in a passenger car.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Opportunity:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are looking for a Software Engineer to join our rapidly-growing product and engineering team (remote friendly - see note at bottom of post!) .

Projects here can include everything from overhauling our data pipeline and building the next great metric to implementing a new CRM and integrating it into our systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Technologies We Use:&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Typescript &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Next.js deployed on Vercel for our front end framework&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Node.js backend framework modeled after Nest.js&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;API integrations with various companies ranging from freight providers to major software companies&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bigquery for our analytics stack&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Google Cloud for our serverless API and NoSQL database&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fully automated deployments using GitHub actions&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What You Will Do:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Own projects from concept to finished product.
