Our Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) team makes sure that Quip is delightfully fast, always available for our customers whenever they need it, and well-insulated from outages or unpleasant surprises.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We never lose sight of one of our guiding principles: you cannot meet these goals at the expense of the health and happiness of the team working on them. Maintaining a healthy and supportive work environment, good work-life balance, and encouraging technical and professional growth for team members is as of much a core value for us as having top-notch operational standards.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our team focuses on keeping our product running smoothly, consistently, and without repetitive manual work (toil). We know we have a keen product, and a fantastic place to work, and we're looking for some great people to join our SRE team to keep everything that way!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;You Would Get The Opportunity To&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Continually develop Quip's operational reliability and simplicity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maintain our observability and automation at the level where we need it to be, by extending existing infrastructure, setting up open source projects, or even developing custom solutions when necessary.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Investigate and repair bugs, mysterious occurrences, and production issues throughout the entire system, in concert with product and infrastructure engineers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Champion operational excellence and production quality across the entire company.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Skills and technologies you'd use (and learn or improve!) here:&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Building efficient, scalable, and reliable products on cloud platforms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Understanding, modifying, and writing Python code, both in our product codebase, and in supporting infrastructure for automation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Using configuration and orchestration tools to create repeatable, auditable, documented-in-code systems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Designing systems for the sweet spot of long-term scale and reliability, while keeping manual maintenance and complexity costs down, and still shipping at reasonable speeds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Things we're looking for in people who we want to join us:&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keen interest in keeping a holistic view of entire systems in mind: patterns, architectures, data flows, lifecycles, edge cases, and risks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Excited about continually reducing complexity, and creating systems that are easily understandable, repeatable, and observable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Convinced about the importance of communication (both verbal and written/online), close team collaboration, and sharing information with others (creating documentation, or in-person training).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eager to learn best-in-field design and engineering practices from coworkers with a wealth of skills and experience, and getting to add your unique mark to what we're building.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Drawn to understand (at a rough level) the basic skeleton of the stacks on which your system operates, from both network (SSL/TLS, HTTP, DNS, TCP, IP, CIDR, local networking, global routing) and host (process/daemon, system library, process supervisor, binary packaging, UNIX distribution, kernel) perspectives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Bonus points (not at all required, but would let you hit the ground running!):&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience running medium-to-large user-facing services on public cloud services, particularly AWS.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience running, scaling, tuning, and debugging production SQL databases, particularly Amazon Aurora MySQL.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience with configuration and orchestration management tools, particularly Terraform and Docker.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience with and opinions about modern best-practice observability/debugging/logging/monitoring stacks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Comfortable writing Python (specifically, Python 3) scripts and libraries, and modifying existing code.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Accommodations &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;If you require assistance due to a disability applying for open positions please submit a request via this Accommodations Request Form.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Posting Statement &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;At Salesforce we believe that the business of business is to improve the state of our world.
