These&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;engineers continue to innovate the platform, now home to over 1.5 million apps&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\u2014 each created using the team\u2019s own software development kit and related&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;services. All those apps mean the store takes billions of requests from more&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;than 500 million visitors every week, across iOS, macOS, tvOS, iPadOS, and&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;watchOS.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To deliver such a rich experience at this scale, the engineers build highperformance&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;systems backed up by persistent systemwide A/B testing.
