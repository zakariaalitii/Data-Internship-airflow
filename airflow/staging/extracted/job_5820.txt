But that value is heavily \"eroded\" in the cost of the high cost of manual labor needed to properly sort materials at recycling centers.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our heavily mission-driven client is &lt;em&gt;revolutionizing &lt;/em&gt;the recycling industry with AI-driven robots. Their products are now working across the country, and they are deeply expanding their reach: Right now, they are a Series B Company with almost 75M in total funding. Their strong mission to make recycling better is just ONE of the many reasons they keep climbing up and up-and-up-and-up our list of the BEST Companies in Colorado.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are helping them hire across the board ... they are hiring for Developer roles,ML/AI roles, EE roles, RoS roles etc. ... That said, we are specifically focused on helping them hire&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Senior Robot Software Engineers&lt;/strong&gt;:&amp;nbsp;They generally hire \"polyglots\" but right now their deepest needs are centered around&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Software &lt;/strong&gt;/ &lt;strong&gt;Hardware Integration&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;ROS and C++ with TypeScript &amp;amp; JavaScript experience a nice bonus :) &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're a Senior/Lead/Staff/Principal Robotics Developer (Front End, Back-End, or Full-Stack )and you want to learn more about this company, OR if you just want to have an open-ended chat about your careers goals, perhaps one of the 37 other Software Engineering roles we are working on could be a good fit&amp;nbsp;for you :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Salary:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;They are hiring at all levels, but so this is a wide range, but the general target for \"Senior Candidates is 130K - 150K, with room to go up to 170K for the right candidates.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits: &lt;/strong&gt;Health, Dental, Vision, 401K, Strong PTO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Their office is in Louisville, but right now and for the foreseeable future (maybe forever), most Software Development teams are working 100% remotely. That said, they do prefer local candidates to keep the door open to meeting a few times a month. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to meeting you!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheers,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Will&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;p.s.
