You will need to listen to and translate inner team requirements into high-level technical specifications, design, and often develop recommended solutions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Solutions can range from as simple as helping a team find the correct documentation to working with the team to design and architect large, complex solutions that could span systems across Apple.
