The company was founded in 2016 by an experienced ad tech marketer and two experienced machine learning experts who had previously worked at Yahoo, Twitter, and BrightRoll. We\u2019re backed by leading early-stage investors including Amplify Partners, Homebrew, and Precursor Ventures. Intellimize intelligently optimizes websites for revenue driven leaders. Our machine learning automatically personalizes the buyer\u2019s path to drive more web conversions. On average, our customers achieve 46% lift. We work with great companies like Drift, Looker, Unilever, Sumo Logic, Tableau, Emburse, and many more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We believe everything we do flows from two things: making our customers wildly successful and having this be the best professional experience of our lives. This company is based on our customers achieving their goals, getting promoted, and getting up on stage saying great things about our work together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since the COVID-19 pandemic, the team has been working fully remotely. While we plan to move back into a San Mateo office once it is safe to do so, the engineering team will continue to embrace a remote-first culture and workflow. We welcome candidates from anywhere in the US or Canada. Our core working hours are centered around the Pacific time zone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;A Few More Things About Us&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Intellimize optimizes websites to generate more revenue. We use machine learning to automatically optimize each buyer\u2019s path to drive more web conversions. Our unique solution enables experimentation and personalization at an unparalleled scale, and it replaces traditional approaches to optimization such as A/B testing and rules-based personalization. These methods are too slow, require daily attention, and don\u2019t automatically adapt to changes in behavior over time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We are entrepreneurs with deep experience in paid digital media and personalization.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Our team has experience building massive-scale personalized recommendation systems and machine learning infrastructure at Yahoo, Google, and Quora.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We move fast. We are data-driven. We get things done.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Our customers are true north.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We believe in the importance of work/life balance to do your very best work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About You&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;You have a degree in CS, math, or another highly quantitative field, or you have equivalent experience&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You understand theory, and you\u2019re also a builder&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You\u2019re a multiplier: your instinct is to make everyone around you more productive&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You\u2019re great at self teaching and teaching others&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You want to work in a startup atmosphere: you adapt quickly, iterate fast, and you communicate clearly, directly, and frequently&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You\u2019re prefer a \u201clight touch\u201d (but not hands off) approach to project management&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You have experience with back-end software engineering and/or machine learning&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You have excellent skills with a general purpose programming language such as Java or C++ (including object oriented design and concurrency)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You have experience with scripting in a language such as Python&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You're familiar with (or have built) service oriented architectures or microservices&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You either have experience with machine learning or are excited to learn about it; we implement ideas from research papers, and working on some of our core systems requires ML knowledge&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You have experience with relational and non-relational databases&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You have experience with web-facing services&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;We\u2019d also love it if you have experience with any of the following:&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;REST APIs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Data engineering&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Low latency services&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;System architecture (working across and defining system boundaries)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Machine learning at scale&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spark&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Airflow&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tensorflow&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Web security&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;What you will work on&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Role&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Here are a few recent and upcoming projects the team has worked on to give you a sense of the scope of this role&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Design an ingestion and storage system that allows our customers to integrate with the data in third-party systems&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Implement a data pipeline for a new class of ML models and orchestrate it on Airflow&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Design an online ML monitoring system that works for batch and streaming models&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add infrastructure- and configuration-as-code tooling to existing systems&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Build the back end for new customer facing features that require complex queries to graph data&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ensure we continue to offer excellent security for our customers&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Why us?&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
