Our contribution to solving the wealth inequality problem is moving people from the debt stack (payroll) to the equity stack. By making it as easy to issue equity to employees as it is to put them on payroll, we can create more owners.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At Carta, we are helpful, transparent, fair, and kind. We are relentless executors, unconventional thinkers, and masters of our craft.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To learn more, here is what one of our investors wrote about leading our Series F.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Team You\u2019ll Work With&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; You will be joining our newest vertical at Carta called CartaX.
