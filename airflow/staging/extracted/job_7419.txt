Build domain knowledge and understand the user &amp;amp; business problems you're solving.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;QUALITY DELIVERABLES - Good software architecture - at QuoteCenter every developer is an architect. You are responsible for creating systems that are appropriately maintainable, scalable, and extensible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;TAKING OWNERSHIP - When a problem comes to your attention, take care of it. If you're too busy with something more important either assign it to someone else or set a reminder to come back to it later.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ALWAYS LEARNING - Be willing to learn whatever technologies, tools, or patterns necessary to solve a problem. Don't avoid a problem because \"someone else 'owns' the code\" - learn the code, learn the domain, solve the problem.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ALWAYS A MENTOR - Continually look for the chance to share your knowledge and skills with others. Even the most seasoned professional can learn new tricks from the most junior developer. There is always something you know that someone else doesn't (and vice versa), so share!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION - Write and speak clearly and concisely. Be prepared to explain your work, decisions, and ideas to your colleagues. Graciously challenge ideas that don't seem right, no matter where they originate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;GOOD TEAMMATE - Have a sense of humor. Build relationships with your colleagues. Work out differences with your colleagues directly. Go to your manager if you're unable to resolve it there. Actively work to disrupt backchannel and office politics. Look for ways to make the work environment better for everyone.", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "The Home Depot", "sameAs": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-home-depot", "logo": "https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E0BAQHzR2llYqUBtg/company-logo_200_200/0/1620049929202?e=1639008000&amp;v=beta&amp;t=czpw2mNVHeCEC9oQaZfS5cqV05onR2vsH9yxDS_tjV4"}, "identifier": {"@type": "PropertyValue", "name": "The Home Depot", "value": "152205"}, "image": "https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E0BAQHzR2llYqUBtg/company-logo_100_100/0/1620049929202?e=1639008000&amp;v=beta&amp;t=efO-DlGpVwwzvAj03SnwtYsJ0Rc4_-TsVWjnvZVduQs", "industry": "Construction,Information Technology and Services,Financial Services", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "US", "addressLocality": "Portland", "addressRegion": "OR", "postalCode": "97268", "streetAddress": null}, "latitude": 45.516018, "longitude": -122.68143}, "skills": "", "title": "Senior Site Reliability Engineer", "validThrough": "2021-10-07T06:14:47.000Z", "educationRequirements": {"@type": "EducationalOccupationalCredential", "credentialCategory": "bachelor degree"}}
