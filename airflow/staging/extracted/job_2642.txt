Unlike many similar positions where you sit in a centralized function sending out idea's/ reports this role will see you partner with a small number of PM's/ Traders meaning you can develop a strong understanding of their investment universe which in turn should allow you to generate more relevant and profitable ideas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given it's proximity to the investment decision making process I see this role as a combination between Data Science and Investment Analysis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past we've had success placing candidates coming from a range of backgrounds, these include Quantitative Researchers looking to move to a fundamental business, Equity Researchers with strong quantitative skills and Data Scientists with an active interest in investments.&amp;nbsp;What all successful placements have had in common is strong technical capabilities (Python, SQL), exposure to different alternative data sets, and experience articulating ideas to PM/ Traders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you believe you have the relevant skills please apply and we can schedule a call to discuss potential next steps.&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "Sartre Group", "sameAs": "https://uk.linkedin.com/company/sartre-group", "logo": "https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C560BAQHrU3vJaEFwkw/company-logo_200_200/0/1558625120224?e=1635984000&amp;v=beta&amp;t=CVXU-NKgU5JrjfsYiINjvwHFbbXPGUC8AX6g7JCT7To"}, "identifier": {"@type": "PropertyValue", "name": "Sartre Group"}, "image": "https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C560BAQHrU3vJaEFwkw/company-logo_100_100/0/1558625120224?e=1635984000&amp;v=beta&amp;t=zCkpvN29rPOmx2UwjZCzrwnVsU48JQTyRo3iRrnIixc", "industry": "Investment Management,Financial Services", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "US", "addressLocality": "New York", "addressRegion": "United States", "postalCode": "13856", "streetAddress": null}, "latitude": 42.93923, "longitude": -75.62005}, "skills": "", "title": "Investment Data Scientist", "validThrough": "2021-09-03T09:56:10.000Z", "educationRequirements": {"@type": "EducationalOccupationalCredential", "credentialCategory": "bachelor degree"}, "baseSalary": {"@type": "MonetaryAmount", "currency": "USD", "value": {"@type": "QuantitativeValue", "minValue": 150000, "maxValue": 300000, "unitText": "YEAR"}}}
