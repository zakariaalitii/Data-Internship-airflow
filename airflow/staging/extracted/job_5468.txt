We are transforming corporations through deep domain expertise, knowledge-based ML platforms, as well as profound anthropological efforts to understand the end customer and design products and interactions that create delight. We are deeply committed to developing a comprehensive understanding of our clients\u2019 problems and to develop platforms to address them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) combines software and systems engineering to build and run large-scale, massively distributed, fault-tolerant systems. SRE ensures that Customer\u2019s services\u2014both internally critical and externally-visible systems\u2014have reliability, uptime appropriate to user\u2019s needs and a fast rate of improvement. Additionally, SRE\u2019s will keep an ever-watchful eye on our systems capacity and performance. Much of the engineering focuses on optimizing existing systems, building infrastructure and eliminating work through automation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the SRE team, you\u2019ll have the opportunity to manage the complex challenges of scale which are unique, while using your expertise in coding, algorithms, complexity analysis and large-scale system design. SRE's culture of diversity, intellectual curiosity, problem solving, and openness is key to its success. Our organization brings together people with a wide variety of backgrounds, experiences and perspectives. We encourage them to collaborate, think big and take risks in a blame-free environment. We promote self-direction to work on meaningful projects, while we also strive to create an environment that provides the support and mentorship needed to learn and grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DESCRIPTION&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;OF DUTIES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Collaborate with software engineers in development, test, as well as CI infrastructure teams with the aim of improving the team\u2019s CI and CD services.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Partner with development teams by providing infrastructure assistance and guidance from the early phases of product development, including the development of software and processes to assist developers in infrastructure-related workflows (such as build, release and deployment automation).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Designs and implements infrastructure for new and existing products, ensuring all business policies for security, supportability and cost are met, while enabling efficient deployment of products through automated means.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Participates in project planning discussions to include the formulation and delivery of cost and labor estimates and options for assigned projects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Designs and implements solutions to provide continuous integration, automated deployment, and configuration management of internally or externally developed applications.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Analyze new and existing products for performance and efficiency improvements, both as part of a structured release process, and as an ongoing process.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Monitor and tune the performance, reliability, and security of the infrastructure. Identify and correct bottlenecks in the system, while working with development teams on optimization and best practices.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Integrates internally developed products, externally developed products, and mixtures of both, to create working solutions from multiple disparate parts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience with cloud services such as RH-Openshift, AWS, Azure, Google and On-prem DCs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strong programming and scripting knowledge, e.g. Groovy, Python, Ruby, PowerShell, Bash, Ansible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Build automation and continuous integration tools (Jenkins, Bitbucket, Artifactory, Sonarqube, Bitbucket, Veracode, Jira, Confluence, Terraform..etc)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strong knowledge &amp;amp; understanding of tools/skills such as Hashicorp Vault&amp;nbsp;, Apigee&amp;nbsp;, Dynatrace, Kubernetes&amp;nbsp;, Docker, Kafka&amp;nbsp;, Kinesis, Sysdig, Cloud Watch, Cloud trail, Lambda, SQL / Postgres, Info Sec best practices, software security&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Support and improve our tools for continuous integration, automated testing, automation and release management making the entirety of software engineering as efficient and effective as possible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Continuous Delivery pipelines implementations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Monitoring and logging systems (e.g. Splunk, ELK)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Understand best practices for source control, build engineering, continuous integration and deployment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Proficiency in the setup, configuration, maintenance, and upgrading of one or more server operating system families (Linux, Windows, etc)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Proficiency with server prototyping and virtualization tools.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Proficiency with version control tools (Bitbucket, Git)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience with SDLC processes (code review, release management, etc) and automation of same (continuous integration, continuous factory delivery)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience with networking protocols (TCP/IP, SSL, etc)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Soft skills in Tenacity,&amp;nbsp;Communication, Troubleshooting (with real world examples of vexing problems), Tolerance for frustration working across disparate locations / time zones, Proactiveness (seeing something and saying or better yet, doing something&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Information Technology, Information Systems, Industrial Engineering, or related field; or equivalent combination of education and experience.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "UST", "sameAs": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/ustglobal", "logo": "https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D0BAQGL3xVMx0edSA/company-logo_200_200/0/1608123394726?e=1637798400&amp;v=beta&amp;t=X8N74tRjH_efVJqI9DC3W4vZJO8QT0Eoi4zWxbCwixg"}, "identifier": {"@type": "PropertyValue", "name": "UST"}, "image": "https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D0BAQGL3xVMx0edSA/company-logo_100_100/0/1608123394726?e=1637798400&amp;v=beta&amp;t=FSgGvrg5Gj9PwrU6ijUoespihFSMPPUCTmFI4-7Q9Cw", "industry": "Information Technology and Services", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "US", "addressLocality": "Allen", "addressRegion": "TX", "postalCode": "75013", "streetAddress": null}, "latitude": 33.104195, "longitude": -96.67174}, "skills": "", "title": "Site Reliability Engineer", "validThrough": "2021-09-21T20:41:58.000Z", "educationRequirements": {"@type": "EducationalOccupationalCredential", "credentialCategory": "bachelor degree"}}
