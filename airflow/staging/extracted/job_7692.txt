Using a keen eye, you\u2019ll develop software and tools in support of many of our high-impact technology platforms such as operating systems, networks, databases and more. While we\u2019re growing in the software business, you\u2019ll still need to see the big picture and watch for hardware compatibility while even potentially influencing design.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Who You\u2019ll Work With&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our hardworking team members are busy programming magic across the globe on teams such as Engineering, Information Technology, Supply Chain, Customer Experience, Security and Trust, etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You would play a crucial role in driving next-gen software innovations including cloud, mobile, desktop or security spaces. On any of these teams, you'll get hands-on experience working with applications that make technology accessible no matter what device they\u2019re on. See the possibilities when creativity meets design and build solutions which will transform how we work, live, learn, and play.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Who You Are&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; Recent graduate or on your final year of studies towards a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, or related program or other academic certification ; equivalent experience accepted in lieu of degree &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Up-to-date on programming and scripting languages C/C++, Python, Java &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Knowledge of Linux, Networking concepts, OS fundamentals, Embedded Development, and/or ML &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Hands on QA, Testing, and/or Debugging skills &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Experience with Databases, Web Application Development, and Web Services &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Eligible to start July/August 2022 &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Able to legally live and work in the country for which you\u2019re applying, without visa support or sponsorship &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Cisco&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we\u2019re \u201cold\u201d (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we\u2019re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do \u2013 you can\u2019t put us in a box!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But \u201cDigital Transformation\u201d is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, you have colorful hair? Don\u2019t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That\u2019s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing?
