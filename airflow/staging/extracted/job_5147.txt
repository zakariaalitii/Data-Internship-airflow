About 25,000 small businesses use our tools and send out our content. Generally, these businesses don\u2019t have marketing departments but are growth-minded enough to know they need to market themselves. Our software helps them do just that. We automate email and social campaigns to drive traffic back to their websites, helping them build better relationships with their customers with less hands-on effort.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are focused on culture and investing in opportunities where our teams are able to grow professionally and inspire one another. We are very results-oriented with a bias to action. We value humility and a team-first, company-first approach and are willing to laugh at ourselves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work Life&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;We believe in a healthy work-life balance. We believe work should be both fun and challenging. We believe team members are most productive at work when they are successful in their personal lives, and vice versa. We embrace an open, transparent, trust-based work environment with a remote-first culture. Many of our team members enjoy the privilege of working from home on a regular basis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testimonial&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;\u201cI love working here!
