It all starts with the Aurora Driver, a platform created from industry-leading hardware and software and designed to adapt across a variety of vehicle types and industries.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We\u2019re led by a team of self-driving luminaries, and we\u2019ve forged strategic partnerships with leading transportation companies\u2014including ride-hailing network Uber, truck-manufacturers PACCAR and Volvo Trucks, and the world\u2019s largest automaker Toyota\u2014setting us up to deliver the Aurora Driver in both trucks and passenger vehicles. We are funded by Amazon, Uber, T Rowe Price, and some of Silicon Valley\u2019s best venture capital firms, including Sequoia, Greylock, and Index Ventures.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aurora is in the best position to lead the self-driving space with a team of unparalleled depth and expertise, the technology to deliver, and the partnerships to build a transformative business for the long-term.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aurora hires talented people with diverse backgrounds who are ready to help build a transportation ecosystem that will make our roads safer, get crucial goods where they need to go, and make mobility more efficient and accessible for all. We\u2019re searching for a Data Science Architect to lay the foundation in making data-informed decisions that impact the Autonomous Vehicle behaviors, verification and validation of Aurora's self-driving technology and business growth. While interviewing, you will be expected to intelligently reason about various applications of data science in the verification and validation of autonomous driving which include heuristics that define safe driving behavior, data adequacy requirements to address sample size issues, and data quality issues. Your role will interface with Product, Autonomy Development, Systems and Safety Engineering teams and will drive mission-critical decisions in a multi-trillion dollar industry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In this role, you will&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Define safety risk framework/architecture to quantify system and subsystem risk&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Define heuristic models and data requirements to establish statistical arguments for good driving behaviors&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Identify key metrics for safety and performance of autonomous driving in selected Operational Design Domains (ODDs), based on first principles, as well as an analysis of manual and autonomous driving miles&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Establish human driving performance and safety baselines in selected ODDs&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Define data-driven targets for autonomous driving performance and safety in selected ODDs. Be able to argue for why those targets are valid and reason about the effect on traffic safety if those targets are achieved&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Guide the design of Simulated and real-world driving experiments to efficiently understand the gaps between achieved system performance/safety and desired targets&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Assist with methodologies and planning for AV verification and validation at system and subsystem level&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Support the development of market entry plans that align market opportunity with technical capability&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Support and educate other technical teams on their data science needs&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Identify, utilize, or create as appropriate the needed technical machinery for large scale data analysis and visualization. In particular, to analyze historical and current data and use it to predict future system performance&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Discover and analyze relevant information from multiple large data sets to further Aurora's mission of delivering Autonomous Vehicle technology Safely, Quickly and Broadly&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Work with Motion Planning, Perception, Safety and Simulation engineers to ensure their respective teams have the information they need to make timely, informed decisions.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Surface succinct, actionable data widely in regularly updated dashboards&lt;/li&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Required Qualifications&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;MS or PhD in Statistics, or a related field.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Experience architecting data and software systems to facilitate reliable statistical analysis at scale&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Practical knowledge of common data analysis, inference, and statistical modeling tools, including Python and/or R&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Self-starter who will see opportunities to apply capabilities that add value throughout the organization&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Superb analytical and problem solving skills, and an ability to deeply understand the \u201cwhy\u201d and \u201chow\u201d of what we are working on&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Strong interpersonal and communication skills&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Excellent planning and organizational abilities&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Ability to technical leadership and mentoring &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Enthusiasm for applying data science to the toughest challenges in autonomous driving&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;6+ years of experience in a Data Science/Statistical Analysis role is preferred&lt;/li&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Working at Aurora&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;At Aurora, we bring together people with extraordinary talent and experience united by the strength of our values.
