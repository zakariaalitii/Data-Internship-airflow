You will work on a hardware/software product enabled by the ML technologies you build.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Qualifications&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;Develop features and models to improve the capabilities of large-scale Deep Learning-based systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Scale up models, build training datasets and tune parameters to maximize system performance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Build software that improves your rate of experimentation and helps you make better decisions about what to try next.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Work with the team to deploy models in a mission critical environment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Able to train and debug deep learning systems: Defining metrics and datasets, performing error analysis, training models in a modern DL framework (such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, etc.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Familiar with current DL literature and the math of machine learning: optimization methods, common types of models and layers, etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Strong background in Python development with Linux. You write clean, correct code while iterating on experiments in Python. Ability to understand and contribute to C++-based software is a plus.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Excellent communication skills. You collaborate effectively with other teams and communicate clearly about your work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;Working with the team you\u2019ll join a fantastic team of hardworking engineers and researchers with deep experience in robotics, machine learning, and software engineering. We hope you\u2019re excited about the values that drive us:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-  Passion for the mission: We\u2019re here to make something great. We take on whatever work is right for the product and strive for the best possible results.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-  Modesty: The right answer is more important than being right. We search for solutions as a team and value clear-eyed feedback.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-  Lean habits: You can\u2019t grow without limits. Time constraints and big goals inspire us to sharpen our focus and learn to make great decisions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education &amp;amp; Experience&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;Bachelors, Masters, or PhD Degree in Computer Science/Machine Learning or equivalent professional experience.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Role Number: 200169370&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "Apple", "sameAs": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/apple", "logo": "https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C560BAQHdAaarsO-eyA/company-logo_200_200/0/1595530301220?e=1639008000&amp;v=beta&amp;t=VRQ9BKHsTKCRgSOVP3ASOFf24I0iK_eDLM5DX2CR5H0"}, "identifier": {"@type": "PropertyValue", "name": "Apple", "value": "200169370_en-US"}, "image": "https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C560BAQHdAaarsO-eyA/company-logo_100_100/0/1595530301220?e=1639008000&amp;v=beta&amp;t=oz006mM8oXhkSW6y-pPXcqpnQkcEGVLOyPD6lN5jHMQ", "industry": "Consumer Electronics", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "US", "addressLocality": "Cupertino", "addressRegion": "CA", "postalCode": "95014", "streetAddress": null}, "latitude": 37.319313, "longitude": -122.02927}, "skills": "", "title": "Machine learning engineer - Perception", "validThrough": "2021-10-06T02:11:30.000Z", "educationRequirements": {"@type": "EducationalOccupationalCredential", "credentialCategory": "bachelor degree"}, "estimatedSalary": {"@type": "MonetaryAmount", "currency": "USD", "value": {"@type": "QuantitativeValue", "minValue": 135000, "maxValue": 206000, "unitText": "YEAR"}}}
