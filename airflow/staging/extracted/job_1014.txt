Offering patients cancer risk assessment, genetic counseling and genetic testing is the right thing to do, but most hospitals (cancer centers, breast centers and women\u2019s health providers) simply don\u2019t have the time or the resources to do it. CancerIQ\u2019s unique technology enables providers to screen, assess and manage entire patient populations based on individual genetic risks. That means they can prevent deadly, early-onset cancers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Providers who partner with CancerIQ can also improve quality of care and staff satisfaction, increase revenues and efficiencies, address social determinants of health, meet guidelines/requirements, and enhance customer loyalty.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;CancerIQ is seeking a Data Engineer with a mission to create a data pipeline that allows our data to be flexible and reliable in efficient ways to gain clinical insights in the cancer prevention and genetics space.
