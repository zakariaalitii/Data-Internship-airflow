We're doing important work that helps people create behavior change \u2014 and that excites you daily.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You're hungry to make REAL impact every single day \u2014 you're motivated by progress and know that the work you do will move the needle.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You're excited to be one of the first ten employees of a startup \u2014 you see the path forward and you're eager to be a part of the journey.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You are a team-player who is able to thrive in ambiguity. You love tackling new projects and building the playbook from scratch. This is not the kind of job where you show up and we tell you exactly what to do every day (micromanagement makes you cringe).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why you might &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be excited about us \ud83d\udc40&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We're a lean, mean fighting machine (under 10 employees). If you like a more established company setting, this role isn't for you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We're a remote-first company, and therefore fantastic communication skills (verbal and written) is vital. If you don't like to over-communicate, you won't be happy here.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We're an early-stage startup. Projects and priorities are likely to shift. If you're not keen on flexibility and a \"learn while we go\" mentality, you may get frustrated easily.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Everyone on the team is extremely mission-driven, and works incredibly hard to push towards our lofty vision. If you prefer a 9-5 job or to rest-and-vest, this job isn't for you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As the very first in-house engineer, you'll be an owner and an operator. If that doesn't excite you, then we're not a good match.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We deeply believe teamwork makes the dream work. If you're not willing to lend a hand wherever it's needed (and sometimes that means it may be outside of your job description), you won't fit in.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Life as a Weep \ud83d\ude00&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;All Wellory team members are referred to as \"Weeps\"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;WFH Office set up \u2615 \u2014 you'll get a new computer + equipment to work comfortably while remote&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Full health insurance coverage, including dental and vision&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unlimited vaca \u2014 we mean it \ud83d\udc83\ud83d\udc83\ud83d\udc83&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Monthly team events \u2014 we're a team that loves to celebrate and spend quality time together. While we may be remote, we plan monthly fun, zoom-style happy hours, team bonding events, virtual comedy shows +more!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The interview process \ud83d\udc4b\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udc4b\ud83d\udc4b\ud83c\udfff&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We'll do our best to respond to all applications as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First Call -&lt;/strong&gt; If it's a match, we'll invite you to chat with our CEO + Founder, Emily, on a 1-hour call to learn more about the company and so we can learn more about you!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second Call&lt;/strong&gt; - If we all get along, you'll move to a second call with our CPO + Co-Founder Jeni, to dive into the role and learn more about our products and tech team.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take-home Assessment -&lt;/strong&gt; Next, you\u2019ll be given a take-home assignment to help us understand how you think, work, and communicate. We value hard work first and foremost!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet Our Advisor&lt;/strong&gt; - Then you'll chat with our technical advisor Jason to dive into technical experience and development at Wellory.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final Chat -&lt;/strong&gt; You'll have one final interview with Jeni to recap learnings and answer any outstanding questions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;References&lt;/strong&gt; - Last step, we'll reach out to people who you've worked with and hear what it's like working alongside you!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "Wellory", "sameAs": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/wellory", "logo": "https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D0BAQFXnx4uwy_sZw/company-logo_200_200/0/1594901169759?e=1636588800&amp;v=beta&amp;t=KnkZUA5reIrAhlcmXbgEqeWLWyCWw_5IDVXMY1idou4"}, "identifier": {"@type": "PropertyValue", "name": "Wellory"}, "image": "https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D0BAQFXnx4uwy_sZw/company-logo_100_100/0/1594901169759?e=1636588800&amp;v=beta&amp;t=hksZjiJLXAdhVT-W4U_HgDXkhTWmb3ntFxKqzKAM3JU", "industry": "", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "US", "addressLocality": "New York City Metropolitan Area", "addressRegion": null, "postalCode": "10021", "streetAddress": null}, "latitude": 40.748295, "longitude": -73.98556}, "skills": "", "title": "Software Engineer", "validThrough": "2022-02-02T16:46:50.000Z", "educationRequirements": {"@type": "EducationalOccupationalCredential", "credentialCategory": "bachelor degree"}, "experienceRequirements": {"@type": "OccupationalExperienceRequirements", "monthsOfExperience": 36}}
