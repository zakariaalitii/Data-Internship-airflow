That means saving lives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Delfi Diagnostics is a Johns Hopkins spinoff focused on the non-invasive detection of cancer at earlier stages, when it is most curable. DELFI uses artificial intelligence and whole genome sequencing to detect unique patterns of DNA fragmentation in the blood of patients with cancer. These analyses are performed through simultaneous examination of millions of DNA sequences using machine learning to identify tumor-specific abnormalities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In our passionate pursuit to radically improve health outcomes, we serve humanity when we:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lead with Science, Anchor in Pragmatism: We pioneer life-changing science by ensuring quality, transparency, and rigor at all times. We explore thoughtfully, experiment smartly, and deliver impact with conviction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Build With &amp;amp; For All: We embrace diverse backgrounds to innovate and achieve together. We are not just building a product - we aim to disrupt the path of cancer for all - no matter geography or socioeconomic class&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Put We over I: We are a home for high-performing people. Through teamwork, we build collective intelligence. Each of us wins when those we serve and those who serve with us--win. We show up with empathy, humility, and integrity at every step of the journey.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this role, you will work with a cross-functional team of Bioinformatics Scientists, Clinicians, Engineers, and other Data Scientists to analyze genomic and clinical data of individuals diagnosed with and at risk of cancer. This position will develop and implement machine learning to models to make predictions about a variety of clinical characteristics, including optimizing our ability to detect cancer early. Results will be communicated to internal and external stakeholders using visualizations. This work will culminate in the development of products with the potential for clinical impact.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt; What You\u2019ll Do &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Develop machine learning models to make accurate predictions about cancer and other clinical characteristics&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Perform feature engineering by working with researchers to establish representations of whole genome sequencing (WGS) data that reflect cancer-driven changes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Develop reproducible analyses using Rmarkdown, Jupyter Notebook, etc and version control using GitWork with our lab team to develop experiments to understand impact on classification performance&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Collaborate with Engineers to implement improvements into our bioinformatics pipeline&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Develop visualizations to interpret and communicate results&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Required &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;MS or PhD in Biostatistics or a related field with three plus (3+) years of experience or equal&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Excellent understanding of machine learning techniques and algorithms&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience with common data science toolkits and libraries, such as R/caret/tidyverse, and Python/scikit-learn/pandas&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience with data analysis and visualization using R and/or python, with a demonstrated ability to apply these skills to relevant scientific problems&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Able to work on a cross-functional team in a collaborative environment&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Working knowledge of Linux&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Preferred &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Knowledge of cancer genomics&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Expertise in computational analysis of high-throughput technologies in genomics, especially with cfDNA&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Demonstrated ability to uncover new biological insights from large genomics datasets&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience with high-performance computing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with product development is a plus&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;An equal opportunity employer&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company.
