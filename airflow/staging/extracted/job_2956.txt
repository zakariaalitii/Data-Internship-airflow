Immigrants are traditionally shut out of the financial system because they lack a financial identity. We are building technology to democratize access to financial services.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Improving access to financial services for everyone, especially for the underserved and immigrants has never been more important. They contribute $1.6T to the economy, have built many $100B+ companies, and generated millions of jobs. Still, immigrants don't get the services they deserve. We are building technology to help immigrants from day 1 of their arrival. Since launch, we have helped hundreds of thousands of immigrants from 160+ countries. We are growing fast and now at an inflection point in our journey to help millions of immigrants.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are based in San Francisco (open to remote), founded by an immigrant team with expertise in finance, technology, and machine learning. 70% of the team is immigrants and from underrepresented backgrounds. We are working hard to make financial services simple by using non-traditional data, building a modern scoring and decision engine, and improving operational efficiency.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is a challenging and fulfilling opportunity for someone looking to make a difference in the lives of immigrants across the world. As we rewrite the approach to banking, we are looking for a Data Scientist who is experienced, knowledgeable, and believes in making this happen with us.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Responsibilities&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Continuously explore new alternative data sources to add incremental predictiveness in the models though orthogonal signals/features.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Build end to end machine learning models, from design, learning, evaluation, validation &amp;amp; monitoring.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Create, expand, explore, rank &amp;amp; maintain logs of innovative internal feature sets for credit, pricing &amp;amp; fraud.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Expand the performance data using organic &amp;amp; synthetic methods wherever possible.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Develop automation capabilities &amp;amp; advanced dashboards required for faster processing and monitoring.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Own end to end model implementation, model iteration, model versioning, for production and sandbox environment&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Collaborate with the engineering and product teams to implement, ship, test and monitor the risk models.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Requirements&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Quantitative Background Bachelor\u2019s (preferably Master\u2019s) degree in Computer Science, Statistics, Mathematics, Financial Engineering etc.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Programming Ability Expert knowledge of Python or R, &amp;amp; SQL.
