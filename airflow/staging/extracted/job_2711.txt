You use data to inform roadmaps, but you also know when you have enough information for action. You love the challenge of prioritizing user needs amongst multiple business objectives. You enjoy growing from diverse perspectives and coworkers while collaborating with others in a cross-functional team, and across departments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You are looking for something more from your job. Maybe a bigger problem to solve with both immediate and long term impact, or perhaps you just need a mission you can believe in every day. You are scrappy and collaborative while looking to join an inclusive and supportive culture with a bias for action. You dig a balanced startup life and can wrestle challenges with grace. You love big, interesting problems and bringing solutions to the masses while making sure it feels personal, authentic and connected. If this sounds like you, we'd like to talk.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why us? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The Mom Project is a pioneering, remote-first venture-backed startup with roots in Chicago &amp;amp; Cincinnati.
