You have experience in business intelligence or data science projects and interfacing with customers or key internal stakeholders.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Results-driven. You're a natural-born executor who loves making to-do lists and getting projects done. When you hit a problem, you have multiple ideas for ways to fix it. &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Excellent communication skills, both written and verbal. You must be able to communicate with all users, from technologists to VPs and CxOs&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Strong interpersonal skills. You will work closely and productively with multiple stakeholders at each customer and internally at Unsupervised.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Strategic thinking. You strive to understand each customer's unique organizational requirements and customize a project plan that helps them quickly realize value while being set up for long-term success.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Accountability. You'll shoulder the technical responsibility of making each customer successful and should both welcome that level of ownership and love solving specific customer challenges.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Process.
