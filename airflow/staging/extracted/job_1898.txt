This includes understanding what training is required or expected through a mapping of universal competencies, and measuring/quantifying if the learning demonstrated the impact through behavior change, capability development, and ultimately business metrics. This helps ensure that measurement is an ongoing and iterative process that transforms Mastery's approach to understanding and meeting the demands of our learners.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a Learning Impact Analyst, you will design and analyze business impact experiments to measure incremental impact on learners (both through behavior change and business results) of Mastery training programs. You will also help develop analysis and insights that help Mastery understand the engagement, reaction, and impact of its content. You will utilize recent developments and new technologies in causal inference to estimate incremental impacts using non-experimental methods. You'll need to be self-driven and comfortable working with various statistical methods, data systems, Application Programming Interfaces, and visualization tools. You will need to possess an excellent acumen for experiment design and incremental analysis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Responsibilities&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Design, develop, and support robust business impact experiments, A/B tests, and incremental impact analyses&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Partner with stakeholders to develop analysis and insights about Mastery's content&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Build statistical models to map impact with training for future business attribution&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Communicate findings verbally, through analysis, documents, and automated dashboards&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Publish results and provide documentation and guidance that centralizes our best practices for others and secure buy-in with leadership to understand, trust, and value the results provided by our team&lt;/li&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Google is proud to be an equal opportunity workplace and is an affirmative action employer.
