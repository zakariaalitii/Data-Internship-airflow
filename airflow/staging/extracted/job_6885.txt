Work with Best in Class open source and visual tools, along with the most flexible and scalable deployment options. Whether it\u2019s investigating patient trends or weather patterns, you will work to solve real world problems for the industries transforming how we live.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your Role and Responsibilities&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The Data Scientist is a role for quantitatively adept people with accompanying business skills. A solid foundation typically in statistics, modeling, operations research, computer science and applications, and math. What sets the data scientist apart is strong business acumen, coupled with the ability to communicate findings to both business and IT leaders in a way that can influence how an organization approaches a business challenge. Data Scientists will not just address business problems, they will pick the right problems that have the most value to the organization.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Data Scientist is effective at deploying an analytics solution, thereby realizing business value. Whereas a traditional data analyst may look only at data from a single source \u2013 a CRM system, for example \u2013 a data scientist will most likely explore and examine data from multiple disparate sources. They will extract, transform, and combine all incoming data with the goal of discovering a previously hidden insight, which in turn can provide a competitive advantage or address a pressing business problem.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Data Scientist does not simply collect and report on data, but also builds statistical models, determines what it means, then recommends ways to apply the data. Data scientists are inquisitive: exploring, asking questions, doing \"what if\" analysis, questioning existing assumptions and processes. Armed with data, modeling expertise, and analytical results, a top-tier data scientist will then communicate informed conclusions and recommendations across an organization's leadership structure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Data Scientist will help transform clients\u2019 data into tangible business value by analyzing information, communicating outcomes and collaborating on product development. They will be responsible for expanding and optimizing data models, prediction algorithms correlation algorithms as well as text analytics models.
