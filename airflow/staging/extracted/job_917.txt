We use machine learning over classroom audio to provide teachers with insights about their instruction, including insights on their teacher-to-student talk ratio, lesson design, use of academic language and \"uptake\", open- and closed-ended questioning technique, think time, and other high-leverage instructional strategies that education research shows improve student outcomes and increase equity in the classroom. In school- and district-wide implementations, the data is anonymized and aggregated to empower instructional leaders to pinpoint equity issues and drive change for students most in need of additional support.
