You\u2019ll be working with varied and diverse teams to deliver unique and unprecedented products across industries. The &lt;strong&gt;Principal Data Scientist&lt;/strong&gt; is primarily responsible for advancing our broad capabilities to use and deploy cutting edge data scientific tools and methods in our projects, platforms and products. S/he both anchors our current best practices by designing and building reusable data science assets, and simultaneously works to keep us on the bleeding edge by understanding the very latest and most sophisticated methods and tools for grappling with extremely large scale and complex problems. As a Data Scientist, you will work alongside our partners in the Digital and other practice groups, engage directly with clients to understand their business challenges, and craft appropriate solutions to be delivered by specialists and consultants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your responsibilities will include, for example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Exploring data and crafting models to answer core business problems that may not have a common blueprint&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Guiding data science consultants on the best path to solving problems in a specific technical domain in which you are the expert&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explaining, refining, and crafting model insights and architecture to bring stakeholders through the journey of model building&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Inventing and pioneer R&amp;amp;D efforts to bring new approaches and state of the art methods to our clients&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Codifying best practice approaches to specific analytical problems in the form of accessible, reusable patterns, templates, and code bases&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leading efforts to standardize and industrialize solutions such that they can be robustly deployed into production and/or scaled up far beyond the laptop-scale&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;____&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YOUR EXPERIENCE &amp;amp; QUALIFICATIONS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are a well-rounded technologist who brings a wealth of real-world experience and a:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Technical background in computer science, data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence, statistics or other quantitative and computational science&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A compelling track record of designing and deploying large scale technical solutions, which deliver tangible, ongoing value:&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Direct experience having built and deployed complex production systems that implement modern, data scientific methods at scale and do so robustly&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Comfort in environments where large projects are time-boxed and therefore consequential design decisions may need to be made and acted upon rapidly&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fluency with cluster computing environments and their associated technologies, and a deep understanding of how to balance computational considerations with theoretical properties of potential solutions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ability to context-switch, to provide support to dispersed teams which may need an \u201cexpert hacker\u201d to unblock an especially challenging technical obstacle&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Demonstrated fluency in modern programming languages for data science, covering a wide gamut from data storage and engineering frameworks through to machine learning libraries&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Expert knowledge of at least one and probably several core machine learning frameworks, including but not limited to: TensorFlow, Keras/Theano, Torch, Caffe, MxNet; Scikit-Learn, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Deep understanding of the architecture, performance characteristics and limitations of modern storage and computational frameworks, with experience implementing solutions that leverage: HDFS/Hive; Spark/MLlib; Kafka, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A history of compelling side projects or contributions to the Open Source community is valued but not required&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Solid theoretical grounding in the mathematical core of the major ideas in data science&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Expert level understanding of a class of modelling or analytical techniques, often supported by Masters- or Doctoral-level research in the subject&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Deep fluency in the mathematical \u2018primitives\u2019 and generalizations of data science \u2013 e.g., expertise in Linear Algebra, and Vector Calculus&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience presenting at high-impact data science conferences and solid linkages to the data science community (e.g., via meet-ups, continuing relationships with academics, etc.) is highly valued&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interest/background in Financial Services, and capital markets in particular; Health and Life Sciences; Consumer, Retail, Energy, or Transportation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;____&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YOUR ATTRIBUTES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our team comprises all sorts of people from all sorts of backgrounds.
