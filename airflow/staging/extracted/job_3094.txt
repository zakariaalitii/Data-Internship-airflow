We have received a National Science Foundation SBIR grant to do research on computer vision for understanding plant geometry. This is a challenging problem in farm fields where many plants can overlap and occlude one another. We\u2019re looking for a remote software developer to help with building and running the software involved in this research. The grant period is 9 months, but if the project goes well there is a good chance that the work will continue after that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Requirements:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;experience with C++&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;experience with Python&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;experience with image processing and/or computer vision algorithms&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;experience with PyTorch and/or TensorFlow&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;based in US&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Optional:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;experience with developing and running machine learning models on AWS&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;experience with OpenCV&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To apply: please send a resume along with a link to some C++ and/or Python code that you have written.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compensation: $117k/year (for 9 months) plus health insurance&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "Modular Science", "sameAs": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/modular-science"}, "identifier": {"@type": "PropertyValue", "name": "Modular Science"}, "image": null, "industry": "", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "US", "addressLocality": "San Francisco", "addressRegion": "CA", "postalCode": "94121", "streetAddress": null}, "latitude": 37.78008, "longitude": -122.42016}, "skills": "", "title": "Machine Learning Engineer", "validThrough": "2022-02-06T00:25:00.000Z", "educationRequirements": {"@type": "EducationalOccupationalCredential", "credentialCategory": "bachelor degree"}}
