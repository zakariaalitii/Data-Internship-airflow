This exact role may not be open today, but could open in the near future. When you apply, a Cisco representative may contact you directly if a relevant position opens.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we\u2019re \u201cold\u201d (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we\u2019re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do \u2013 you can\u2019t put us in a box!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But \u201cDigital Transformation\u201d is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, you have colorful hair? Don\u2019t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That\u2019s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing?
