{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "JobPosting", "datePosted": "2021-09-02T05:22:58.000Z", "description": "&lt;strong&gt;Because you belong at Twilio. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Who, What, Why And Where&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Twilio operates over 50 different public APIs. The DX Standards team builds automated tooling and infrastructure that act as guard rails for the 100+ teams that design and implement these APIs. Our mission is to make all Twilio APIs feel familiar and consistent for developers at all stages: from the brand new developer trying out their first Twilio API to a developer who uses many different Twilio products and APIs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;They Also Have&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Twilio is looking for a Software Engineer (L4) who lives the Twilio Magic and has a demonstrated track record of delivering software at a high quality bar.&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; 6+ years of experience in software engineering or devops roles &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; A passion for API Design and open standards like Open API &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; A bias for collaboration, both with product management and other engineering teams, to get work done efficiently &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Experience building automated pipelines with CI/CD systems &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Full-stack and serverless software development experience a plus &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Expert-level knowledge of Javascript and at least one compiled language like Java, Go, C#, etc. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;As a Software Engineer on the DX Standards team, you will live the Twilio Magic values:&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; DRAW THE OWL: Twilio's APIs are powered by hundreds of microservices. This role will require a spirit of Drawing the Owl to understand how they fit together and architect clever solutions within the constraints of the system to be successful. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; WRITE IT DOWN: Enforcing quality and consistency shouldn't leave developers confused and lost if their pull requests are blocked by automation. We Write it Down to document exactly what our standards are and what folks can do to get themselves unblocked. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; DON'T SETTLE: This team is about consistency, after all. While we're a new team, we balance scrappiness with not settling for mediocre solutions -- we'd rather build a few things well rather than many things poorly. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; EMPOWER OTHERS: This team doesn't carry around a banhammer -- instead we are the advocates for the voice of developers who use Twilio. We amplify those voices through empathetic automation rather than evangelism, because automation scales and empathy keeps the human touch. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Twilio's Engineering organization has grown orders of magnitude within a few years. In order to stay ahead of ongoing growth, the DX Standards team was formed to scale out standards of good Developer Experience in an automated way that lets us raise all ships when we make decisions about API design. Success for this team is measured in the consistency, predictability, and lovability of the APIs we ship to customers. This is a role with multiplicative impact -- you'll be building tooling that helps make every team at Twilio better.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Twilio is a company that is empowering the world\u2019s developers with modern communication in order to build better applications.
