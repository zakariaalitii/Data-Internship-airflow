These packages are currently being used by more than 3,125 organizations worldwide (in 89 countries). As of February '21, more than 1.25M downloads of these MPI libraries have taken place from the MVAPICH project site alone. In addition, these libraries are available with the software stacks of many server and interconnect vendors, Linux distributors (RedHat and SuSE) and packages (Spack and OpenHPC). This library has also been enabling many TOP500 systems during the last decade. More details on this project can be obtained by visiting MVAPICH project web page.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The MPI software engineer/programmer is expected to take a lead role in MVAPICH2, MVAPICH2-X, and MVAPICH2-GDR projects and work together with the graduate students, research scientist, post-docs, programmers and faculty member in this group to design and develop production quality code with novel features. Strong experience in Linux, C programming, network programming (such as TCP/IP and low-level networking stacks), etc. is required. Knowledge on MPI standards, multi-core processors, GPGPUs/accelerators, and high-performance networking is desired. The candidate should also be familiar with the typical design cycle (design, develop, test, tune, release, bug fixes, etc.) for producing and maintaining high quality software and the associated tools. The candidate should have good communication skills and team working experience. An M.S./B.S. degree in computer science or computer engineering with a few years of experience (especially working in a team project) is preferred. Other exceptional candidates with degrees from other disciplines and having at least five years of experience in working in the field of computer science/computer engineering will also be considered.", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "The Ohio State University", "sameAs": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-ohio-state-university", "logo": "https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E0BAQEw433uw5btkQ/company-logo_200_200/0/1519856416206?e=1637798400&amp;v=beta&amp;t=L2-0LR8DB979icXl1ei97ZbMOwKRlg8QhYUhCALAoQA"}, "identifier": {"@type": "PropertyValue", "name": "The Ohio State University"}, "image": "https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E0BAQEw433uw5btkQ/company-logo_100_100/0/1519856416206?e=1637798400&amp;v=beta&amp;t=AKIaMYfKOtbDWGUFUDQiG-qP8vePR576cVWEIWogFhk", "industry": "", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "US", "addressLocality": "Columbus", "addressRegion": "OH", "postalCode": "43272", "streetAddress": null}, "latitude": 39.96276, "longitude": -82.99629}, "skills": "", "title": "Software Engineer", "validThrough": "2021-09-18T01:03:39.000Z", "educationRequirements": {"@type": "EducationalOccupationalCredential", "credentialCategory": "bachelor degree"}, "experienceRequirements": {"@type": "OccupationalExperienceRequirements", "monthsOfExperience": 60}}
