We have a desire to question, to understand, to figure it out. Bottom line, we solve it. We value not just the truth but the process to get to the truth, to deliberate, decide and then act. Most importantly, we care. We care about our customer. We care about our company. We care about our team. There will be long days and incredible challenges.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are blazing a trail in an industry that hasn\u2019t changed in nearly a century, and that doesn\u2019t scare us (well, not all the time) -and even when it does, it doesn\u2019t stop us, it energizes us.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Do you see yourself here?
