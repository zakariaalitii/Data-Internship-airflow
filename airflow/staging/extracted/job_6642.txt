You will work with teams across the company to research new types of fraud, develop new products, and provide analysis to drive sales and marketing. This is a full-stack data science role, involving model development, analysis, and writing production code. You should be interested in having end-to-end ownership and a fast-moving environment where deep domain understanding drives development and unusual insights drive our competitive advantage rather than optimization of new machine learning methodologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technologies: Python 3, PostgreSQL, and AWS infrastructure (EC2, S3, RDS, Redshift, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Develop and maintain SentiLink\u2019s fraud detection models through the full model development lifespan: from data acquisition decisions through featurization, focusing labeling resources, model training, experimentation, productionalization, and monitoring&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Research new types of fraud and develop new SentiLink products around identity verification&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Write production-ready code that can be relied on for real-time decision making by our partners&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Design, perform, and present analyses that will inform data acquisition, product development, risk operations priorities, marketing, and sales efforts&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Work with engineering, risk operations, and data acquisitions to access necessary data, maintain data quality, and support data access&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Requirements:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2+ years relevant work experience and PhD or Master\u2019s in a technical field or 2+ years additional relevant work experience&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People who generate creative ideas that provide our competitive advantage&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interest in developing deep domain expertise for product-focused work: a background in fraud is not required, but willingness to learn is&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ability to design, perform, and present thoughtful statistical analysis with business-changing implications&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience writing production code and tests&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Understanding of different machine learning models and their trade-offs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Detail oriented and thoughtful -- someone we can rely on to make business-changing decisions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ability and desire to take initiative and follow projects through to completion&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bonus for familiarity with: fintech or adjacent industries; identity solutions; distributed computing frameworks; data engineering; AWS&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "SentiLink", "sameAs": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/sentilink", "logo": "https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D0BAQFvCcYdQN1jyw/company-logo_200_200/0/1519900607680?e=1638403200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=tcMPyBQF-jsVJOg1F9lP1VeahZawbQsr6588f6rB9wo"}, "identifier": {"@type": "PropertyValue", "name": "SentiLink"}, "image": "https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D0BAQFvCcYdQN1jyw/company-logo_100_100/0/1519900607680?e=1638403200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=JsNxTNop-wlWoxK31lmjXIhLZad_ntnAUb2fXv4viZM", "industry": "Information Technology and Services", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "US", "addressLocality": "San Francisco Bay Area", "addressRegion": null, "postalCode": "94112", "streetAddress": null}, "latitude": 37.39271, "longitude": -122.042}, "skills": "", "title": "Data Scientist", "validThrough": "2021-09-29T19:06:32.000Z", "educationRequirements": {"@type": "EducationalOccupationalCredential", "credentialCategory": "bachelor degree"}, "experienceRequirements": {"@type": "OccupationalExperienceRequirements", "monthsOfExperience": 24}, "jobLocationType": "TELECOMMUTE", "applicantLocationRequirements": {"@type": "Country", "name": "United States"}}
