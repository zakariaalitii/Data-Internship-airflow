You know the best software is created through collaboration and iteration and you\u2019re looking for the right opportunity, and the right team, to expand your experience. You seek feedback because it has the ability to turn good work into great work. You like to ship software early and often, you value simplicity and strive to eliminate unnecessary complexity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ClassPass is looking for engineers with a ML background who are excited to develop their software engineering skills. Our engineers are the brains behind some of the fitness industry\u2019s biggest breakthroughs.

Much of our team comes from non-traditional computing backgrounds; we know that by bringing together a diverse set of voices we\u2019ll be able to build a better product, and a better company. We care less about what languages or frameworks you know, and care more that you are excited to produce high-quality code and be constantly learning. Our engineers work in cross-functional teams that are focused on impact, and movement between teams is encouraged. We work very closely with our brilliant product team to deliver a world class user experience, and ultimately to empower our users to live their fullest, healthiest lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Responsibilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Collaborate closely with Product and Data Science teams to iterate on the design, implementation and deployment of data products&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Build software to implement and&amp;nbsp;manage machine learning systems and applications&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Understand reliability and performance, and proactively find and address issues to manage data at scale&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Write clear and concise technical design documents and gather feedback from your team and the broader engineering organization&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Provide ML leadership and mentorship through code reviews and technical discussions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seek different perspectives, and solicit honest feedback&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Take delight in delighting our users&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Care about our studio partners and want to help them grow their business&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skills &amp;amp; Experience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Proficiency with Java, Kotlin, or Python&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience in machine learning, data engineering, deep learning, search, natural language processing, data science, or computer vision&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strong analytical and problem solving skills&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Excellent written and verbal communication skills&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nice to Have&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience with some standard machine learning tools: Amazon SageMaker, Flink, Tensorflow, PyTorch, Theano, HDFS, Hive, or Athena&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Understand reliability and microservice monitoring best practices&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have we piqued your curiosity?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if you don\u2019t think you \u201ccheck every box\u201d on the job description, we encourage you to apply.
