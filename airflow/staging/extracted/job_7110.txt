Initially built to take the pain out of peer-to-peer payments, Cash App has gone from a simple product with a single purpose to a dynamic app, bringing a better way to send, spend, invest, and save to our millions of monthly active users. We want to make the world\u2019s relationship with money more relatable, instantly available, and universally accessible. This is our mission, and it\u2019s why working at Cash App means so much more than a job.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Today, Cash App has thousands of employees working globally across office and remote locations, with a culture geared toward creativity, collaboration and impact. We\u2019ve been a distributed team since day one, and we\u2019ve got offices and remote teammates across the globe. Our offices are great, but many of our roles can be done remotely from the countries where Cash App operates. No matter the location, we tailor our experience to ensure our employees are creative, productive, and happy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Job Description&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Cash App\u2019s Financial Platform team is responsible for building systems that power products built by Cash App. We build deep integrations with underlying financial infrastructures and ensure that our products are able to scale.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;About the teams that are hiring in the US &amp;amp; Canada for Financial Platform:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acquiring:&lt;/strong&gt; The Acquiring team builds &amp;amp; maintains the systems that handle card payments, enabling funds flows both to and from cards issued around the world.

In addition to taking over operation of the existing ACH infrastructure, which moves hundreds of millions of dollars every week, we\u2019ll be building out platform support for mechanisms such as wire transfers, SEPA, and locale-specific real-time payment rails (Faster Payments, RTP), remote check deposit, and paper money deposit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treasury: &lt;/strong&gt;The Treasury team is responsible for ledgering of all our customers' stored value transactions and the settlement of funds with our external banking partners. The Treasury team works closely with product teams to ensure funds flows of new and existing products are supported.
