To be successful, you will need baseline software development knowledge across the application stack. Your ability to organize ideas into code and supporting tests will be a key contributor to your growth. You will be challenged to refine some details of your implementation and praised on others. Curiosity will drive you to understand why your check-in broke the build while lending a hand in maintaining the pipeline.
