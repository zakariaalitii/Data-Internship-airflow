Our backend is composed of many different micro-services built using Spring Boot Rest APIs and Apache Storm, backed by a combination of technologies to fit our scaling needs like PostgreSQL, Cassandra/ScyllaDB, Kafka, Redis, and Elasticsearch allowing us to process billions of events using an event-based architecture. All of this is hosted on AWS utilizing tools like Terraform and Ansible to manage our infrastructure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At Virgin Pulse we are a big believer in teams owning their features and we have instilled a motto of \u201cbuild, deploy, run\u201d. This means teams don\u2019t just develop features, but they are also responsible for deploying and supporting their features in Production. To support this, we practice CI/CD, allowing each team to deliver value to our customers in as short amount of time as possible, while also giving our teams a continuous feedback loop by using tools like New Relic, ELK, and CloudWatch to monitor application health and performance. The times of weekly, bi-weekly, or even quarterly releases are a thing of the past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Who You Are&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Responsibilities &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) is what you get when you treat system operations as a software engineering problem.
