Since then Square has been building an entire business toolkit of both hardware and software products including Square Capital, Square Terminal, Square Payroll, and more. We\u2019re working to find new and better ways to help businesses succeed on their own terms\u2014and we\u2019re looking for people like you to help shape tomorrow at Square.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Job Description&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;We&amp;apos;re making a hardware wallet for the next 100M bitcoin users.
