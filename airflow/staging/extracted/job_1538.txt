This role entails working on all aspects of HarperDB core including product install, our data storage layer, distributed data replication, RESTful interface, and all areas in between. We are looking for someone early in their career who is eager to learn and grow in the role.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;HarperDB is a distributed database focused on making developers lives easier while delivering easy to use tools that help reduce global data latency. We are primarily focused on Gaming, Media, and e-commerce use cases, but also work with customers in other areas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We highly value transparency, focus, accountability, and kindness in our team. We try our best to be good humans. We work very hard, but also believe strongly in supporting a healthy work life balance. We value creativity and flexibility of thinking. We believe in finding good people and helping them grow in their careers. Our team is fully remote currently, with no plans to return to an office. We are mainly in the Denver area, but have teammates spread out across the US.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;HarperDB is experiencing massive growth, which is fun and exciting, but also intense. We are looking for someone who is a good team player, wants to help HarperDB scale, and build new products and services. We are a startup which comes with a lot of fun, innovation, and flexibility, but also means that sometimes priorities shift on a dime, that we are a small, scrappy team, and that sometimes we need help outside core hours.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you are not scared away yet, please send your resume!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Requirements&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;We are looking for someone who generally fits the skillset below, but open to helping the right candidate learn in areas where they might lack experience&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Required&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Node.js development&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Experiencing using SQL and NoSQL databases&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Experience building RESTful interfaces&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Familiarity with version control and other development tools&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Minimum 2 years professional experience&lt;/li&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Bonus Points&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Experience with WebSockets or other pub/sub based communication protocols&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Experience with Docker, Kubernetes&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Experience using cloud services (AWS, Azure, GCP)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Experience with Linux based OS&lt;/li&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;Salary $75k - $100k + Equity&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Benefits Healthcare, Vision, Dental, 401k, Unlimited PTO, Flexible Working Hours", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "HarperDB, Inc.", "sameAs": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/harperdbinc.", "logo": "https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C560BAQFbgxV84353Cw/company-logo_200_200/0/1578586651840?e=1635984000&amp;v=beta&amp;t=FnlOyIi9qDgEQHkoDYqVfUiKQ7X2-X_I3pWUnpFLPE8"}, "identifier": {"@type": "PropertyValue", "name": "HarperDB, Inc.", "value": "20D3362FB1"}, "image": "https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C560BAQFbgxV84353Cw/company-logo_100_100/0/1578586651840?e=1635984000&amp;v=beta&amp;t=9weUwBoKqcBVYUYvP3dCRAxEStQiegMKqmEdyVIUghc", "industry": "Computer Software", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "US", "addressLocality": "Denver", "addressRegion": "CO", "postalCode": "80247", "streetAddress": null}, "latitude": 39.738453, "longitude": -104.984856}, "skills": "", "title": "Software Engineer", "validThrough": "2021-08-22T03:29:48.000Z", "educationRequirements": {"@type": "EducationalOccupationalCredential", "credentialCategory": "bachelor degree"}, "experienceRequirements": {"@type": "OccupationalExperienceRequirements", "monthsOfExperience": 24}}
