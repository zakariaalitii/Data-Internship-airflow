Are you a problem solver; someone who enjoys debugging code, resolving issues, and creating solutions for common problems? Do you get a little obsessed with the details?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are looking for a Software Engineer to join our Data and Discovery organization. As a global company that works with both local businesses and consumers, Groupon has a wealth of data, which is stored and processed on our ever-evolving data platform.

You will be working on significant data platform solutions with a high business impact by collaborating with Data Engineers, Data Scientists, Product Managers, and Software Engineers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We're a \"best of both worlds\" kind of company. We're big enough to have resources and scale, but small enough that a single person has a surprising amount of autonomy and can make a meaningful impact.
