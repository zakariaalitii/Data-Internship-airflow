Foxy AI uses cutting-edge artificial intelligence and computer vision to convert everyday real estate photos into treasure troves of data. Our models help investors, startups, and public companies&amp;nbsp;streamline workflows and improve quality assurance, generate new insights, and sharpen the accuracy of Automated Valuation Models (AVMs).&amp;nbsp;This is an opportunity to get on the ground floor with a fast-paced team delivering revolutionary solutions to a long-established industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consulting with our ML advisor, you will own our ML pipeline, an integral piece of the product. You will be responsible for building and productionizing new models from the ground up as well as expanding upon existing models. You must have the ability to implement models in production to solve actual business problems. You must have a comfortable understanding of Docker, and Dockerizing microservices on GPUs, interacting with our frontend React code, optimizing our pipelines, and deploying and maintaining on AWS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We're a small team so wearing many hats is necessary, and we are looking for somebody who is both excited by the possibility of stepping into a new machine learning startup as a self-starter and a quick learner.&amp;nbsp;As the team grows, you will help recruit junior engineers and be responsible for managing those on your team. The candidate would not only be a part of development, but an integral part of the team, contributing to ideas and IP of a web-scale Computer Vision application.&amp;nbsp;Everyone on the engineering team contributes to the full product vision.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should absolutely love what you do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CANDIDATE MUST HAVE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The candidate must have the ability to implement deep learning algorithms in production to solve actual business problems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ideally 5+ years of experience with deep learning and computer vision.
