We offer unique opportunities for smart, hands-on engineers with the expertise and passion to solve difficult problems in distributed highly available services and virtualized infrastructure.&amp;nbsp;At every level, our engineers have a significant technical and business impact designing and building innovative new systems to power our customer\u2019s business critical applications.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oracle Tactical Edge Cloud (OTEC) is a new product that extends Oracle Cloud beyond the datacenters and brings its core features to customer locations, even those without consistent internet access. We are building a complex yet exciting offering that will span across cloud services and a fleet of ruggedized, high powered devices that will handle a wide range of specialized workloads in collecting, processing and analyzing massive amounts of data where low latency computing is critical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Position Overview:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Site reliability engineering (SRE) discipline in OCI incorporates the ethos of software engineering and applies it large scale operations problems. As a SRE your primary goals are to create highly reliable and ultra-scalable software systems to manage the operations of our services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A SRE will spend a significant amount of their time doing \"ops\" related work such as production issues and service on-call. When not working on operations the SRE is working on software engineering tasks such as design and development of systems that increase our reliability, scalability and reduce operational overhead through automation. The ideal SRE candidate is proficient programmer who has large breadth of knowledge and experience including areas such as networking, internet protocols and Linux systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our SREs are close partners with service owners in all aspects of service operations and ownership. We have a strong culture of innovation, collaboration and team work inspired by the DevOps philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Responsibilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; Work closely with development team on maintaining operational health of core compute services for API availability and low latency&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Managing and triaging tickets. Driving prioritization and execution of work based on impact.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Scale systems sustainably through mechanisms such as easy to use tooling and automation. Work in concert with service developers to evolve systems/products for better scalability, reliability and development velocity&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Drives new runbooks to help reduce mean triage time of incidents. Prioritize and automate high hit count runbooks&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Practice sustainable incident response and drive root case analysis&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Qualifications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;BS degree in Computer Science or related technical field involving coding or equivalent practical experience&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Understanding of Linux operating systems and Linux system administration&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strong understanding of Linux/Unix commands&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience automating tasks with scripting languages such as Python, Bash, and JavaScript&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Systematic problem-solving approach, strong communication skills, a sense of ownership and drive&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Deep understand of service metrics and alarms through the development of dashboards, service KPIs, alarming systems&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience working in an operational environment with mission critical tier one services with associated pager duty&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "Oracle", "sameAs": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/oracle", "logo": "https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E0BAQGmS4ZS9i2T6w/company-logo_200_200/0/1568109893443?e=1638403200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=8nz0_jOuTp9qTyeeNsArsz_mRSlEduy-nGUZlTD692Q"}, "identifier": {"@type": "PropertyValue", "name": "Oracle"}, "image": "https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E0BAQGmS4ZS9i2T6w/company-logo_100_100/0/1568109893443?e=1638403200&amp;v=beta&amp;t=avpesgZUHtDKrNKXWlPLe-07eRvwjKTkMG1DAFCkM9I", "industry": "Information Technology and Services", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "US", "addressLocality": "Seattle", "addressRegion": "WA", "postalCode": "98133", "streetAddress": null}, "latitude": 47.60323, "longitude": -122.33028}, "skills": "", "title": "Site Reliability Engineer", "validThrough": "2021-09-30T00:12:01.000Z", "educationRequirements": {"@type": "EducationalOccupationalCredential", "credentialCategory": "bachelor degree"}}
