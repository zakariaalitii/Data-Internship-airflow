        "description": "In Mixed Reality, people\u2014not devices\u2014are at the center of everything we do. Our tech moves beyond screens and pixels, creating a new reality aimed at bringing us closer together\u2014whether that\u2019s scientists \u201cmeeting\u201d on the surface of a virtual Mars or some yet undreamt-of possibility. To get there, we\u2019re incorporating groundbreaking technologies, from the revolutionary Holographic Processing Unit to computer vision, machine learning, human-computer interaction, and more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We\u2019re a growing team of talented engineers, program managers and artists putting technology on a human path across all Windows devices, including Microsoft HoloLens, the Internet of Things, phones, tablets, desktops, and Xbox. Our team has people from a wide variety of backgrounds, identities, previous work histories, life experiences, and we are eager to maintain and grow that diversity. Our varied backgrounds and unique experiences enable us to be better at building the best solutions for our customers and make for dynamic and joyful collaborations with colleagues!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The mission of our team is to make fundamental contributions to advancing the state-of-the-art in object detection, tracking, semantic segmentation, and land-use classification in aerial imaging using deep learning techniques. We conduct research by using public benchmarks as well as proprietary datasets, and apply our findings on real customer\u2019s data to deliver high-value solutions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are an extremely agile team and we move very fast from ideas to experimentation, and to product development. If you are passionate about exploring new ideas and product impact at the same time, this job is for you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Responsibilities&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;You will work to apply the latest Computer Vision and Machine Learning algorithms to build customer-centric solutions &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When needed, you will modify and advance the state-of-the-art approaches in object detection and tracking, semantic segmentation, and land-use classification to deliver the best possible solutions to our customers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You will optimize the run-time performance of the latest Computer Vision and Machine Learning algorithms to meet customer\u2019s requirements on various hardware platforms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Qualifications&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;4+ years\u2019 experience in Deep Learning/Machine Learning&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Good knowledge of deep learning approaches to object detection and segmentation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hands-on experience in Machine/Deep Learning using frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strong python coding background &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strong cross-discipline collaboration skills &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great communication, written and verbal&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Masters' degree in Machine Learning/Deep Learning or similar areas &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Let Us Know If You Have Experience With&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;There are plenty of other skills that aren\u2019t required, but you\u2019ll find useful in this role.&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Optimizing for GPU (cuda-level coding, C/C++ coding)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience shipping computer visions or machine learning based runtimes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience with computer vision tracking technology&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ph'D degree in Machine Learning/Deep Learning or similar areas &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Ability to meet Microsoft, customer and/or government security screening requirements are required for this role.
