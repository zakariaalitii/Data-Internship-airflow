In particular, our team is responsible to build, maintain, and operate the Monitoring-as-a-Service portfolio of monitoring solutions for the entire GBU organization. Our solutions monitor several million entities, at high frequency, that span all layers of the GBUCS stack that includes Storage, Network, Server and the Application services. The monitoring platform is a highly distributed, 24*7 system that collects, transports, processes time-series and log events and provides utilities to alert and visualize massive telemetry data accurately and reliably.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About the Job&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you want the challenge of working in a cutting-edge environment, solving technical problems, identifying improvements, and implementing your recommendations?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This role lets you design, develop, troubleshoot, debug software for controlling and managing distributed services, multi-level abstractions, end-end automation, monitoring and telemetry and all activities to deliver&amp;nbsp;infrastructure services via code. If you have hands-on experience with analyzing, designing, testing, and implementing solutions, this key role might be for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What You'll Do&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an SRE in the monitoring services team you will be designing and maintaining hosting, process, transform, and analyze operational processes.
