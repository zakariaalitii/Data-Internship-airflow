        "description": "&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About Netskope&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Today, there's more data and users outside the enterprise than inside, causing the network perimeter as we know it to dissolve. We realized a new perimeter was needed, one that is built in the cloud and follows and protects data wherever it goes, so we started Netskope to redefine Cloud, Network and Data Security.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since 2012, we have built the market-leading cloud security company and an award-winning culture powered by hundreds of employees spread across offices in Santa Clara, San Francisco, Seattle, Bangalore, London, Melbourne, and Tokyo. Our core values are openness, honesty, and transparency, and we purposely developed our open desk layouts and large meeting spaces to support and promote partnerships, collaboration, and teamwork. From catered lunches and office celebrations to employee recognition events (pre and hopefully post-Covid) and social professional groups such as the Awesome Women of Netskope (AWON), we strive to keep work fun, supportive and interactive. Visit us at Netskope Careers and follow us on Twitter @Netskope and Facebook.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Netskope Threat Labs is a team of security researchers and subject matter experts working together to solve today\u2019s toughest security challenges in new and innovative ways. The team focuses on threats to data and infrastructure in the cloud and attackers that abuse the cloud. We work closely with the security, data science, product, and engineering teams to develop novel protection strategies against emerging cybersecurity threats. Our research has been presented at conferences across the globe, including Def Con, Black Hat Europe, CAMLIS, MALCON, Nullcon, and AVAR. Netskope has been recognized as a leader in the \u201cMagic Quadrant for Cloud Access Security Brokers\u201d (CASBs) for four consecutive years and as visionary in the 2020 \u201cMagic Quadrant for Secure Web Gateway\u201d (SWG).
