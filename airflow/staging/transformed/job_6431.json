        "description": "&lt;p&gt;Mercari is Your Marketplace. We make it super easy to sell (or buy) almost anything. We all have things we don\u2019t use, never used, or simply outgrew. But that stuff still has value. Mercari gives you the power to sell it, ship it, and earn some cash for it, simply and intuitively. Fashion to toys. Sporting goods to electronics. All the brands you know and love. Our mission is simple: to make selling as easy as buying. And with 50M+ downloads in the U.S. and 350k+ new listings every day, we're just getting started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the Software Engineer of the Growth Engineering team, you will be leading efforts to maximize the number of activated and engaged users.
