DA focuses on winning Government and commercial R&amp;amp;D projects in the areas of machine learning (ML) and sensor development. Due to recent project wins we are looking for an additional hire to help us build ML solutions. We are specifically looking for people with 5+ years of experience in taking ML techniques described in the literature or on Github and applying those techniques to build custom ML solutions for our customers. Ideally, a successful candidate will have experience in the following areas:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Developing test plans and collecting field data from sensors&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Building datasets for training ML algorithms&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Performing data analysis in a Linux environment (mandatory requirement)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Training ML algorithms, e.g., CNNs, GANs using real-world data&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. Training ML algorithms using TensorFlow and PyTorch&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;6. Exporting and optimizing ML models for inference on embedded platforms&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;7. Strong Python experience&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;8. Developing custom signal / image processing schemes to process sensor data&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;9. Executing technical work collaboratively in an R&amp;amp;D environment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;10. Working on U.S. Department of Defense projects&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nature of our small business requires everyone on the team to wear lots of different hats. Successful hires will perform solid technical work, have a passion for learning, and have an interest or demonstrated experience in writing proposals. Candidates must be self-starting problem solvers, and will be expected to design, implement, and test algorithms with limited guidance under deadline.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Candidates will have the freedom to provide direction to projects and company initiatives. Interested applicants should submit a resume and a cover letter summarizing projects completed by the applicant that are relevant to this job posting. Due to the nature of DA\u2019s projects, U.S. citizenship is required.
