        "description": "Healthcare is going through an unprecedented transformation towards digital care and Medallion provides critical administrative infrastructure to make that possible. Our platform enables organizations to license their providers in new states, verify existing credentials, and get in-network with insurance payers. In less than a year, we\u2019ve launched our platform, built an all-star team, powered dozens of great companies, and served thousands of healthcare providers across the industry!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The heart of Medallion\u2019s success lies in bringing modern technology and automation to the archaic world of healthcare administration. Our web platform and API provide a robust (and, dare we say, delightful!) abstraction over hundreds of healthcare systems, processes, and protocols from medical and insurance bodies across the US. This abstraction is brought to life by a suite of data integrations, web crawlers, and backend intelligence that turns crucial but complicated, manual processes into automated, turn-key solutions, critical to the growth of our customers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Medallion is built by a small, distributed team of seasoned product-minded engineers with decades of experience across startups and public companies alike. We pride ourselves on our level of product ownership (we don\u2019t have a PM yet!); respect and trust for each other; and an ability to execute extremely fast on new ideas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We've raised $20M from some of the best investors like Spark Capital, Optum Ventures, Elad Gil, Peter Reinhardt, and many others.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Collaborate with other engineers to build core infrastructure and features (develop web apps, write backend services, organize data stores, orchestrate cloud tools, and more).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Work with internal and external stakeholders to discover and design new product features&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Participate in (and influence) sprint planning, roadmap development, and other team processes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Help build an awesome company :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Requirements&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2+ years of experience working on software teams&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Proficiency with a general-purpose backend language \u2013 Python, Go, Ruby, Java, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Comfort with backend systems \u2013 web applications, databases, cloud infrastructure, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Comfort with Javascript (or an appetite to learn)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A desire for ownership, impact, and growth&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;",
