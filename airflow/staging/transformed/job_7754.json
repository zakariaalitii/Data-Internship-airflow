If it doesn\u2019t exist yet, we will build it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;- have a sense of humor (well, we think we do).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an early member of their data science team, you will help&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;- push the limits of what can be done with data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;- build the team and drive the direction of the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;- shape our product and culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;- experience the direct impact of what you build on hundreds of millions of people\u2019s financial lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following are required&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;- the tools: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Spark, SQL and fundamental database operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;- recognized open-source contributions and/or top performance in data competitions (Kaggle, Numerai, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- fluency in statistics and probability.&lt;/p&gt;",
