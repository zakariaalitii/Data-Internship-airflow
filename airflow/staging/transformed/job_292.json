        "description": "&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Naval Nuclear Laboratory is seeking a Controls System Engineer/Scientist, with focus on software development, to join our examination equipment design and support team - a multi-disciplined, talented group of mechanical, electrical, and control systems engineers/scientists who develop innovative electromechanical examination equipment for use at the Naval Reactors Facility (NRF). The electromechanical equipment performs remote handling, assembly, disassembly, and precise examination operations in uniquely challenging remote environments \u2013 underwater and in hot cells.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This position provides the opportunity to apply and further develop your software development skills in the area of control system design for these automated exam systems. This includes bringing your software design expertise and input as part of the integrated design team as it selects control system and remote motion components and designs control system cabinets. This position will act as lead to write motion control, data acquisition, and data processing software, teaming to develop and execute test plans to verify compliance with functional requirements, and author documentation to transfer essential knowledge to end users. Following design and delivery of the exam equipment, the team periodically supports emergent problem resolution, allowing development and application of troubleshooting skills. The team also designs system upgrades based on obsolescence and other functional needs. Control systems engineers/scientists are also cognizant for performing cybersecurity assessments and plans of action to evaluate/mitigate risk as appropriate to ensure secure systems. Team members perform a mix of hands-on work in the laboratory environment where systems are designed and tested as well as office-based work to author documentation. Minimal travel is required, primarily for periodic field support when deploying of new systems.",
