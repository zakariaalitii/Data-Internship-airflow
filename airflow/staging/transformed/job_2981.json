You understand that observability is crucial, and you have a dashboard of metrics that prove it. You dream about new ways to optimize cloud infrastructure. You laugh maniacally as you design chaos engineering tests. Your root cause analysis walks the fine line between detail and brevity while understanding the true goal is to learn, teach, and adapt.
