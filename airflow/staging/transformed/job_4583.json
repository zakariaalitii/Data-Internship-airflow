        "description": "Are you interested in AI and machine learning technology, especially involving speech and language? As one of Microsoft\u2019s most exciting AI initiatives, speech recognition (SR) is driving the accuracy and robustness of natural user interfaces with natural spoken language and their deep integration to user facing produce/service from Microsoft 1st party or 3rd party application. The Speech Group develops speech recognition features in Enterprise, Entertainment and Desktop and Mobile products and particularly in the voice platform that powers Microsoft 365 conversational transcription services, Search and Assistant experience on desktop and mobile computing devices, Bing voice search, Microsoft Office dictation, Skype speech to speech translation, HoloLens and Xbox voice search and voice command.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Speech Group brings together talents in the areas of signal processing, speech recognition, statistical modeling and Deep Learning to develop and deliver robust, natural and scalable speech recognition, across a rich set of scenarios and languages. As a science team in the Speech Group, our modeling team pioneered the industrialized deep learning speech recognition technologies, and contributed key innovations to the speech community. Now, we are making some key bets on end-to-end architecture for speech recognition which could be the next big wave. We work on all kinds of end-to-end speech technologies in both back-end and front-end, targeting on the most challenging problems by inventing new algorithms. To that end, we welcome scientists who are passionate at innovating the state-of-the-art speech recognition technologies, which impact millions of users.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our group, at its core, values individual creativity and passion and is a place where we expect every scientist to continually grow both technically, and personally. We value people who can bring a diverse perspective to our product and where a scientist will not just develop ML models but will have a real meaningful impact on the direction of the product and which features to build. We are building a team where diversity of thought and background is valued as strongly as technical skills, and where everyone is encouraged to come up with new ideas to make our customers\u2019 lives better. You will find great R&amp;amp;D opportunities on real data sets provided by one of the world\u2019s largest speech/online data feedback loop. You must have a track record of sustained thought leadership, leading innovation and creative vision. You are up to the technical &amp;amp; competitive challenges of a fast-moving technology impacting many of Microsoft\u2019s key businesses.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Responsibilities&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Essential attributes and competencies include: Excellence in scientific thinking and execution, ability to drive efficient experiment definition and investigations, solid skill in developing state-of-the-art machine learning and speech recognition algorithms, broad scope in solving speech recognition related problems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your responsibilities include developing novel speech recognition algorithms to advance state-of-the-art speech recognition technologies for real world user scenarios, Investigating and solving speech recognition accuracy and robustness issues across all processing chains, including model development, test and quality control, deployment and user feedback stages.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Qualifications&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Basic requirement:&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Master/PhD Degree in CS/EE with focus in one or more of machine learning related areas. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;3+ years experience in speech or machine learning R&amp;amp;D in an academic or industrial setting; large scale and distributed computing, and programming with scripting languages.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Familiar with machine learning/deep-learning tools. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Preferred&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; Strong research and/or development experience with speech recognition, machine learning, data mining, natural language processing, pattern recognition.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Experience in architecting, developing and delivering advanced engineering projects is a strong plus.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Proven track record on innovating speech recognition technologies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Effective communication skills, both verbal and written.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Passionate and self-motivated&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Microsoft is an equal opportunity employer.
