        "description": "When it comes to using cutting-edge machine learning to tackle complex problems, Lockheed Martin is driven by a singular mission focus and desire to continuously innovate. Today\u2019s challenges to global security aren\u2019t just changing \u2013 they\u2019re accelerating faster than ever before. Through our dedication to our mission, our AI-enabled systems are changing the way militaries operate and protect their forces, the way first responders fight fires, and how researchers explore the far reaches of space and the ocean\u2019s depths.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Lockheed Martin Artificial Intelligence Center (LAIC) team is seeking a high energy individual with a strong working knowledge in software engineering, artificial intelligence and machine learning to support the Applied AI team and product portfolio, focusing on a broad range of projects across the LAIC. The team is focused on exploiting small, innovative and agile teams to rapidly iterate and mature solutions from prototypes to deployment for utilization across the Lockheed Martin enterprise and in the field for our customers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The selected candidate will focus on the development of technologies and products that leverage Artificial Intelligence to provide discriminating capability to our customers. This will require engagement in every phase of the system development lifecycle including requirements generation, system and software design, implementation, integration, and flight test. Activities will range from low TRL research, proof of concepts, development of prototypes, building demonstrators, and transition to production. The selected candidate can expect to utilize current AI paradigms including computer vision, deep learning, and reinforcement learning, applying these techniques to solve complex problems and field innovative solutions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Must exhibit self-motivation, a strong work ethic, time management and interpersonal skills.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is a strong preference for the selected candidate to be based in Shelton, Connecticut with the core team.
