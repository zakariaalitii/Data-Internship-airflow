        "description": "&lt;p&gt;We\u2019re partnering with one of the best performing hedge funds looking to add to their Investment Data Science team as they continue to scale their New York office. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The role focusses on utilizing quantitative methods to analyze alternative data sets in order to generate trading signals. Unlike many similar positions where you sit in a centralized function sending out idea's/ reports this role will see you partner with a small number of PM's/ Traders meaning you can develop a strong understanding of their investment universe which in turn should allow you to generate more relevant and profitable ideas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given it's proximity to the investment decision making process I see this role as a combination between Data Science and Investment Analysis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past we've had success placing candidates coming from a range of backgrounds, these include Quantitative Researchers looking to move to a fundamental business, Equity Researchers with strong quantitative skills and Data Scientists with an active interest in investments.&amp;nbsp;What all successful placements have had in common is strong technical capabilities (Python, SQL), exposure to different alternative data sets, and experience articulating ideas to PM/ Traders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you believe you have the relevant skills please apply and we can schedule a call to discuss potential next steps.&lt;/p&gt;",
