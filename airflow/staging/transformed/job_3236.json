We are seeking an individual who is interested in developing software solutions to streamline laboratory processes. With the increasing amount of data generated by researchers, it is our responsibility as software engineers to provide solutions to streamline their work. When the laboratory succeeds, we succeed. While enabling the progress of cutting-edge science, this is also an opportunity to learn the latest and greatest software development patterns and practices. Other main responsibilities include:&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Work with laboratory users to implement and test new workflows&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Write documentation and help users with issues&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Develop APIs to expose data for services and websites&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Design front-end web pages for laboratory users to complete workflows&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Collaborate with scientific stakeholders to create or modify requirements defining software services&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Deploy solutions to cloud infrastructure via CI/CD pipelines&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About You&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Are you a Software Engineer who is interested in building software to help others? The ideal candidate will have a BS/MS in Computer Science or a related field. Experience in the biotech industry is a plus but not required if skills and enthusiasm are aligned. We currently work as a team in a hybrid work environment. You should feel comfortable working on your own in such an environment. To support you, we utilize online project management and source control to delegate and accomplish our development needs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Skills And Technologies, You Should Be Familiar With Include&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Python or related programming language.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;HTML and JavaScript&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Git and source control systems&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;SQL and interacting with database systems&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Scripting in Linux and Windows Environments&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;In addition to the above skills experience, you will also interact with the following technologies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience working with LIMS or Laboratory Software.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Laboratory Automation (Liquid handlers, Plate readers, Dispensers, etc\u2026)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;AWS&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;ORM&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vue.js&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet your future team &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The Informatics team members typically fit in two categories, bioinformaticists and software engineers. The bioinformaticists are responsible for ensuring data integrity and quality while also maintaining the development of genomic pipelines. The software engineers are responsible for developing services and portals for end-users as well as managing cloud-based infrastructure. We also utilize several domain-specific contractors who remotely on our team to provide additional resources for development. Together the informatics team provides critical support and design services for the R&amp;amp;D laboratory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are primarily remote with the occasional visit to the laboratory when onsite testing is required. By utilizing modern development methodologies and remote conferencing tools we have maintained a high level of productivity and software delivery. If you join our team, you can expect to join a fast, fun, exciting and collaborative environment. We look forward to fostering your skills, learning from your experiences, and building amazing software together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;EEOC Statement: Intellia believes in a diverse environment, and is committed to equal employment opportunity for all its employees and qualified applicants.
