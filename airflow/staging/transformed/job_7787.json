The product is expected to be a significant percentage of Facebook revenue growth in the coming years.We are looking for experienced Data Scientist to lead the monetization efforts on WhatsApp by helping us scale and optimize Click to WhatsApp ads (CTWA Ads). CTWA Ad is one of the fastest growing ad formats and is on track to be a significant revenue driver for the company. It leverages the power of Facebook and Instagram reach and WhatsApp\u2019s core functionality of delightful and private messaging. It allows businesses to target users in Facebook, Instagram and other properties across Facebook, Inc. and enable the businesses to open WhatsApp threads and start interacting with users over WhatsApp. For example: A business which sells apparel, uses CTWA ads to open threads with customers where they sell the product, provide discount and accept payments from customers. The product (CTWA ads) is being used by millions of small businesses (many without websites) to support and scale their businesses, particularly important during the current pandemic. The product is in a sweet spot, where it has already proven strong product market fit and generating meaningful revenue.
