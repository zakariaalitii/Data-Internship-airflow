You'll play a role in improving the lives of millions of creatives and the industry through the Behance Network; a platform for creative professionals. Our team of designers, developers, and community managers work hand-in-hand to create revolutionary products that connect and empower the creative world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our Frontend Developers are tasked with delivering beautiful and highly usable interactions in our products. In this role, you\u2019ll work directly with designers, community managers and other developers to implement new features and improvements on Behance. We focus on using the best approach- and modern tools - to create maintainable, modular code. Being primarily focused on building features that encourage more product adoption, you\u2019ll be involved in gaining insights about how our products are actually being used and be part of investigating new ways to deliver more to our users.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Do you get excited about solving complex problems to create simple, functional UIs? Are you a curious developer who loves to experiment and use data to drive decisions? From working closely with designers to collaboratively writing code, this role is all about finding creative solutions to real world problems!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What You'll Do&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Build strong development skills. You\u2019ll work with the latest technologies to build modular and maintainable features and products.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Work with a multi-faceted team. You\u2019ll work most closely with our designers, community managers, and other software engineers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Build features that make our products easier to use. We\u2019re constantly experimenting with how to improve our products to benefit our users, and you\u2019ll help track metrics and formulate ideas to improve and increase adoption on Behance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Responsibilities&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Build new features. Use tools like React, Sass, css-modules, and more to build modular, componentized code. You'll also use our Continuous Deployment platform to push code to production early and often (and you'll push on your first day here).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Influence design thinking among development team. You have an appreciation for design-thinking and you believe that creating reusable code and consistent user experiences that work well together can empower engineers and designers to create better products.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Participate in pair programming and peer reviews. You\u2019ll collaborate with other engineers on problems of all shapes and sizes, from code to new ideas and methodologies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Provide recommendations on how to make the products more usable. You will use our analytics tools, user research, and in-house community team to gather information and gain insights as to how people use Behance to drive new ideas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What You Need To Succeed&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A keen eye for design details and a strong sense of good UX.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Desire to build design systems and influence how they impact the product design and engineering process.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;An interest in learning about data-driven web development and how to use that to make more delightful products.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience building clean websites that work across different devices and browsers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience working with designers and developers to take a project from concept to life.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Passion for building meaningful, beautiful products that empower the creative world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;",
