You will build ML tools for anomaly-tracking to enable rapid, more effective clinical trialing and the integration of data sources throughout the life sciences.&amp;nbsp;You will model the trajectory of disease across patient populations to identify key opportunities and indications and to rapidly test and develop candidate medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will map and optimize the complex interrelationships of pharma companies, drug manufacturers, pharmacy benefit managers, payors, and patients to drive EQRx\u2019s strategy to dramatically lower drug prices while promoting equity and access. You will use novel computational techniques to design, refine, and select novel drug candidates.&amp;nbsp;Using the tools of modern data science and machine learning, you will help to build a data driven, end-to-end digital native life sciences company, enabling our core mission of rapid, equal, and equitable access to medicines.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Impact You'll Have&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;You will help to radically lower drug prices and expand access, by identifying novel opportunities for partnerships and delivery across the complex web of interrelationships that bring drugs from pharma companies to patients. You will speed the development and trialing of novel medicines through the unification, comprehension, and modelling of human health and disease across data sources. You will drive the adoption of machine learning for the improvement of human health in building a radically different, digital-native and data-first life sciences company, where we bootstrap our way to rapid increases in scale and efficacy across functions. You will enable experts across EQRx to see further, connecting data from biology and chemistry, to the clinic and patients, to drug pricing and delivery, powering a novel, modern paradigm in drug development.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your Superpowers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;You have a PhD (preferred) or Masters (with 3+ additional years exp) in a quantitative scientific field such as physics, computational biology, chemistry, engineering, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You are fluent in python (strongly preferred) or R and cloud native data science.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You have significant experience in the data science in industry.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You thrive working with messy and complex data, understanding key nuances behind its generation and able to model them with quantitative and machine learning tools to achieve understanding.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You are an excellent communicator, able to translate complex analyses into insightful visuals and presentations for audiences with a wide range of technical backgrounds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You are empathetic with end users; proficient at turning business and scientific questions into testable, clean, and reproducible data scientific workflows.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You have a quick, flexible mind, able to rapidly learn new fields and use data science and machine learning to improve decision making and workflows.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You are an avid reader of the literature; excited to try novel tools and techniques to solve problems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;",
