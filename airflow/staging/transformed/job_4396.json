We are a team within the Uber AI Platform (better known as Uber Michelangelo) that is paving the way for Data-centric ML. We pioneered the use of the Uber ML Feature Store as a fundamental building block of the ML lifecycle across the industry - which powers models at Uber for training and serving at millions of QPS with very low latencies. Our ongoing mission is to develop MLOps infrastructure and tools to create high quality features and labels for use in machine models, with the goal of fully automating the lifecycle of feature engineering at Uber and beyond. We work closely with Data Science and Machine Learning teams across Uber to develop algorithms and tooling for sharing, discovery, computation, selection, transformation and monitoring of features and embeddings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Minimum Qualifications&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;PhD or equivalent in Computer Science, Engineering, Mathematics or related field AND 2-years full-time Software Engineering work experience OR 5-years full-time Software Engineering work experience, WHICH INCLUDES 3-years total technical software engineering experience in one or more of the following areas:&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Programming language (e.g. C, C++, Java, Python, or Go)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Note the 3-years total of specialized software engineering experience may have been gained through education and full-time work experience, additional training, coursework, research, or similar (OR some combination of these). The years of specialized experience are not necessarily in addition to the years of Education &amp;amp; full-time work experience indicated. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Required&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical skills:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Distributed systems&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Preferred&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Production experience with low-latency microservices at scale in distributed cloud environments&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Production experience with scalable data processing at scale in distributed cloud environments&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Production experience with feature Engineering Lifecycle in ML systems&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Production experience with applying Information Theory concepts in building scalable feature selection algorithms&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience with building feature embeddings from high dimensional feature sets&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Demonstrated use of ML techniques in Personalization or Recommendation Systems&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Production experience with product engineering&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Production experience with scalable engineering at scale in distributed cloud environments&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;At Uber, we ignite opportunity by setting the world in motion.
