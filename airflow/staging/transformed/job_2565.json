We are building a machine that can see inside of anything and cloud-based software for processing the complex, volumetric data that the machine produces. Our technology will give engineers, designers, and eventually medical practitioners more confidence in their processes and lower the barrier to high quality imaging and inspection tools.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our team of engineers includes world-class researchers, industrial designers, PhDs, founders of successful startups, and zero egos. We are backed by some of the top venture capital funds and angel investors in Silicon Valley and beyond. The company is headquartered in Cambridge, MA and has an office in San Francisco, CA.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About The Role&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Work closely with Meter\u2019s hardware team to develop cutting edge software systems. Systems-thinking and the ability to evaluate a problem from multiple perspectives is a must. We are developing customer-facing software grounded in an innovative technology stack. This role will involve understanding data flow through a complex hardware-software system, characterizing and optimizing performance of different parts of the system, rapidly prototyping potential solutions, and always keeping the customer in mind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you are interested in joining a well funded growth stage company this is the perfect opportunity for you to become a part of the Meter team. This role can be located in either Meter\u2019s San Francisco or Boston office.
