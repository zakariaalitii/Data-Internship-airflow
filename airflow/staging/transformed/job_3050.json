Vijay\u2019s first project was to design and implement text-to-apply support with store-specific SMS codes so that users can easily apply for an Affirm loan in brick-and-mortar stores, and merchants can granularly view application rates and data on a store-by-store basis. &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Madeline&lt;/strong&gt; has built batch data pipelines to enable greater resiliency and accuracy in Affirm\u2019s loan origination processes with our loan origination bank. She has implemented a system to report all loan applications created with Affirm and sourced data from various data warehouses across the company. &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kevin&lt;/strong&gt; has been responsible for a major overhaul of our cryptography platform, which is used to encrypt sensitive customer data such as social security numbers and credit reports, as well as to perform other cryptographic operations. Additionally, he has designed and implemented a public key infrastructure for mutually authenticated and encrypted communication between backend services. &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What We Look For:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, a related field, or equivalent training/fellowship/work experience &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; Experience with one of the following languages: Python, C/C++, Java, Javascript and/or similar languages &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; Familiarity with deployment and automated testing frameworks &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; Ability to collaborate with your team in a fast-paced environment &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; Passion and drive to change consumer banking for the better! &lt;/li&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location - Remote U.S.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The majority of our roles can be located anywhere in the U.S. (exclusive of the U.S. Territories) and Canada (with the exception of Quebec).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Check out our remote-first approach to learn more about the new ways we work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you got this far, we hope you're feeling excited about this role.
