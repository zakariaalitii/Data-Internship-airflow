They're operators at heart and enjoy working with world-class talent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We're exceptionally proud of the company we've built so far and humbled by the work we have yet to accomplish. Our people are Quinn's most significant competitive advantage, and we'll continue investing in them as a cornerstone of our culture.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE OPPORTUNITY \ud83d\udcab&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;As a Machine Learning Engineer focused on search and recommendations, you\u2019ll help us build out our core product by developing high-impact, user-facing features. You\u2019ll be developing in a fast-paced environment, working with a high-performing team, touching all parts of the product. You\u2019ll be learning and growing, and you\u2019ll be doing it quickly. This is a high-impact role as you\u2019ll be working directly with our founders.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You'll design and implement your features to be scalable and resilient. That might include hurdles like the complexities of a real-time, single-page web application, scaling backend services under high load, and developing algorithms to enable unique features. You'll develop tools for other teams that will make their lives easier while also advancing the product for our customers. As an early hire, you will have a significant impact as a positive driver of Quinn's engineering culture, processes, and technology.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We will measure your success by your ability to ship fast, learn quickly, and contribute to our culture of continuous improvement.

However, we\u2019re always open to working with other new and emerging technologies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Skillset \u26a1\ufe0f&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Requirements&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Study and transform data science prototypes&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;5 years of experience or a related degree.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Design machine learning systems&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Research and implement appropriate ML algorithms and tools&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Develop machine learning applications according to requirements&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Select appropriate datasets and data representation methods&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Run machine learning tests and experiments&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Perform statistical analysis and fine-tuning using test results&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Train and retrain systems when necessary&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Extend existing ML libraries and frameworks&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Keep abreast of developments in the field&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Great attention to detail&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;An analytical mind&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Experience building productivity software preferred&lt;/li&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;IS THIS ROLE NOT AN EXACT FIT?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sign up to stay in touch, we'll let you know when we have new positions on the team.",
