        "description": "&lt;strong&gt;This is a fully remote position. It will be open and accepting applications until 5 PM EST on MONTH, DAY, YEAR.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work on things that matter&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Ad Hoc is a digital services company that helps the federal government better serve people. Our teams use modern, agile methods to design and engineer government systems that connect Veterans with services, bring affordable health care to millions of people, and support important programs like Head Start. And as we work to make critical government services intuitive, accessible and human-centered, we\u2019re also changing how the government thinks about and uses technology. If you thrive on change, want to help close the gap between consumer expectations and government services, and can see the possibilities in ambiguity, then we want you here with us.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What Matters Most&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Ad Hoc lives, acts and behaves according to our commitment to inclusivity, acceptance, accountability, and humility. We aren\u2019t heroes. We believe in missions larger than our individual selves and leave our egos at the door, learn from our mistakes, and iterate in order to better serve the people in our country. We prioritize building teams that represent the diversity of the people our government serves. We love the challenge of government-size projects. We want to bring modern skills to our partner agencies, help them better meet the needs of their users, and close the gap between consumer expectations and government.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Built for a remote life&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Ad Hoc is remote-first and remote-always. We\u2019ve designed our culture, communications, and tools to support a nationwide distributed team since the beginning. Being remote by design allows Ad Hoc to be thoughtful and intentional about creating diverse teams and supporting them with a work environment that fits their lives. With a generous PTO policy and Slack channels for every interest (from bird watching to space nerds to parenting) our culture embraces the things happening in your life. Maybe you need to adjust your schedule to care for a family member or take a bike ride. At Ad Hoc, that\u2019s embraced.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What You\u2019ll Do&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;As an Ad Hoc QA Engineer, you\u2019ll be part of a cross-functional team, working closely with stakeholders, product managers, designers, and other engineers. We\u2019re looking for a driven and organized engineer to help our teams deliver the very best digital services for the public.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our ideal QA Engineer knows how to test both frontend and backend code to ensure it is performant and meets business needs. They\u2019ll need to be able to understand requirements, specifications, and design documents, and they\u2019ll need to be able to create detailed test plans and test cases. They\u2019ll need to be able to develop and apply testing processes to both new and legacy codebases.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;As An Ad Hoc QA Engineer, You\u2019ll Be&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shipping software that impacts the lives of millions of people.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Using modern testing languages and frameworks to build automated tests that can be integrated into CI/CD deployment pipelines.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reviewing requirements, specifications, and technical design documents to establish traceability and provide feedback.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Creating detailed and well-structured test plans and test cases.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Performing thorough regression testing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Testing APIs that support both the digital services we deliver as well as third-party usage&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Create unit and integration tests to ensure systems meet business needs and perform as expected.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Helping us continuously, iteratively improve.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;What We Hope You'll Bring&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A minimum of two years of experience testing in major open-source languages and frameworks such as: React, Angular, Vue.js, JavaScript, Typescript, Java, PHP, Ruby, and Go.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A deep understanding of the fundamental technologies of the front-end: HTML, CSS, that sort of thing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience developing public-facing web applications and services.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A solid understanding of accessibility requirements, especially Section 508 and WCAG.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience using automated testing frameworks and languages such as Selenium, Puppeteer, SonarQube.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Building automated tests for cloud environments and automated deployment pipelines, such as AWS or Azure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with mocking data or scrubbing for PII is helpful, too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Solid spelling, grammar, and communication skills.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A commitment to agility, flexibility, and iteration.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;More than that, our ideal candidate wants to contribute to work that is bigger than themselves, and wants to make a difference collaborating with their team. They care deeply about building better products, better relationships, and better trust in each interaction people have with their government. They believe in intuitive, easy-to-use government services. They collaborate well with designers, stakeholders, and other teams. They mentor and guide more junior engineers. They\u2019re human-centered.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And if you don\u2019t check every box on the list? That doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t help us in our mission to deliver critical government services. Talk to us!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Some Basic Requirements&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;All work must be conducted within the U.S., excluding U.S. territories. Some federal contracts require U.S. citizenship to be eligible for employment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You must be legally authorized to work in the U.S now and in the future without sponsorship.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As a government contractor, you may be required to obtain a public trust security clearance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some of our available roles are on federal contracts that require a degree or additional years of experience as a substitute.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Our technical screening involves completing a homework assignment that is then graded blind to remove bias. We do not do tricky, unreliable whiteboarding tests. You can read more about our homework here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Learn more about engineering at Ad Hoc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pay range $108,006 - $126,700 commensurate with experience&lt;/em&gt;",
