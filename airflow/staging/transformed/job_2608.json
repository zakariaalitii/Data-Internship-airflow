We are an ambitious startup, well funded by a top tier VC with an experienced team who have built multiple successful companies and raised over $500M.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are solving a true pain point that every company has and keeps having as they grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are on a mission to hire the very best and are committed to creating a culture where everyone is respected and has access to equal opportunity. We know that new ideas can come from anywhere in the organization, and the next big idea could be yours!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What Are We Doing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting a company has become easier, but growing a company is more complicated than ever. We are building a real-time, smarter financial infrastructure to put trustworthy data into the hands of decision-makers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are currently remote, but will have a hub in San Francisco.

Redundant, resistant and secure.&amp;nbsp;And accuracy is key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is your opportunity to be an early engineer at a well funded startup that has a successful founder and a drive to change how company's leverage their financials.
