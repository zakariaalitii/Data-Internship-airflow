As the worlds leading mission capability integrator and transformative enterprise IT provider, we deliver trusted and highly differentiated national security solutions and technologies that keep people safe and secure. Peraton serves as a valued partner to essential government agencies across the intelligence, space, cyber, defense, civilian, health, and state and local markets. Every day, our 22,000 employees do the cant be done, solving the most daunting challenges facing our customers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Responsibilities&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;This &lt;strong&gt;Space Communications Systems Engineer&lt;/strong&gt; will support development and maturation of requirements for a Capstone demonstration. This is a fast-paced program that will deliver a minimal viable product capability to support the Warfighter in under 18 months as an initial capability delivery with refinement during future development over the next 5 years. A focus of this role is working with more than one SV vendor to identify gaps in the architecture and interfaces and refine the CONOPS based upon expected Segment capabilities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The successful candidate will support a new program at Peraton, focused on mission integration of a new space domain architecture for Space Programs. This role is focused on Systems Engineering and Mission Integration of the Communication Transport Segment into a larger system-of systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tasks include&lt;/em&gt;: assessing the capabilities planned for the Communication Satellite Vehicles and supporting the Chief Engineer to develop and implement a plan to ensure that the combined system will be able to support the mission capabilities. Mission operations (demo and other flight test planning) has a direct interface with the Warfighter and brings together the capabilities of space based communication transport via low-latency high-bandwidth optical link and mesh networking capabilities, an OPIR sensing mission, Ground C2, network management, tactical data links (Link-16 and IBS), mission planning, and DoD elements already conducting critical Warfighter missions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Responsibilities&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Provide data to support information mapping mission capabilities to System and Segment requirements and verification activities&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Provide input to Systems Architects to develop architectural and technical schematics showing interactions (e.g., operational functions, data, physical connections, data flows and timing) among the segments and their various elements&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Integration of new Link-16 equipment into Link-16 test environment &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Integration of optical inter-satellitelinks and space-based mesh networking techniques&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Support Risk reduction activities and end-to-end demonstration plans coordinated with the Transport Segment and elements&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Evaluate the demonstrations, simulations, and testing required to demonstrate mission capability and document the interfaces, internal and external operations and resources required to successfully accomplish them&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Support the Transport Segment (multiple vendors) participation in the Capstone detailed design, analysis, planning, and integration activities&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Required Skills&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Qualifications &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Requires 10 to 12 years with BS/BA or 8 to 10 years with MS/MA or 5+ years with PhD.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Requires a minimum of an active Top Secret clearance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience supporting integration activities for a similar satellite communication systems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience defining the interface requirements for a COMM transport satellite.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Design of new Link-16 equipment and testing in Link-16 in operational test environment or familiarity with optical intersatellite links, or space-based mesh networking development or the integration of new Integrated Broadcast System equipment (desired)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Integrated Broadcast System equipment (desired).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ability to work in a team environment with minimal supervision required.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Willing to travel to Chantilly, VA and Government/Vendor sites, as needed, for integration activities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;",
