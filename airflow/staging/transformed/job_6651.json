When our founder, Angela, gave birth to her daughter Elodie, she learned that the first 1000 days of her life were the most impactful to her growth and development, yet the baby food options available were filled with sugar and often sat on the shelf for up to 2 years! We formed Yumi to give kids a healthy start, with nutrition and content for the first 1000 days of life. We started by delivering fresh pureed food to your home and are growing to provide many more solutions to young families. Join us in shaking up the $48 billion domestic baby food market.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Data scientists at Yumi have the opportunity to work on a variety of challenges to help scale Yumi. You'll be part of a small but mighty team of creative problem solvers, who are leveraging data to move the needle on childhood nutrition.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;We're Excited About Candidates Who&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Enjoy databasing in Mysql or Postgres.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Write code with Python, R, or Julia&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have experience scaling data operations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are curious about how things work and don't stop until you find out.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Possess a mastery of google-fu to find an answer to any problem.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Care about humans and the prospect of creating healthier, happier future generations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;",
