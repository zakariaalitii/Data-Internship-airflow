We are driven by staunchly held principles - we are in service to patients and their best possible outcomes, patient privacy is paramount, and scientific integrity is essential.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Truveta we believe that artificial intelligence will play a critical role in accomplishing our mission towards saving lives with data. An important component of this work is building deep intelligence and making it available to clinical researchers and medical community overall in accelerating building high quality equitable solutions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;This Opportunity&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;We are building a trove of quality healthcare data suitable for medical research and advancing health knowledge. This is an exciting and enormously challenging endeavor where rigorous scientific practice must be blended with robust cloud engineering technology. Specifically in the areas of Real World Data and Real World Evidence, as well as results about the potential risk or benefits of a medical treatment or practice. Using these results to complement or guide clinical experiments can significantly accelerate improvements in therapies and procedures. If you are drawn to work in this space and have a background in applied statistics, data science or computational biology we invite you to join us.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Responsibilities&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Working with large clinical datasets, applying your knowledge of population statistics, estimation, comparative analysis on real-world health data to generate insights that broaden our understanding of patients' diseases and care pathways.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Your work will empower data scientists, medical researchers and power published life science dashboards.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A firm grounding in statistics and data science theory and practice is required.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You will apply computational statistics and data tools and techniques in a production operational environment with data sets that are updated on a daily or hourly basis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ability to interpret and evaluate different analysis approaches from the standpoint of accuracy and feasibility.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Effective communication when discussing your domain with fellow data scientists and non-scientists alike&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While not essential, exposure to quantitative medical research whether through clinical trials or observational studies is beneficial.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Beyond using data science tools like R and Python, familiarity with building high quality, fast, reusable software components is helpful.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Key Qualifications&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bachelors or Graduate degree in Computer Science, Data Science, ML engineering, Applied Statistics or Applied Math&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2+ years experience in data analyses, using Python, R, Scala, Java or similar data language.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Truveta? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Be a part of building something special.
