        "description": "More than half of American workers live paycheck-to-paycheck. Stuck in this cycle, they collectively lose over $120 billion each year on payday loans, bank overdrafts, and fees. We\u2019re trying to fix that by building new financial services that make it easier to plan ahead, pay down debt, and save. And we\u2019re doing it as a transparent, straightforward business that only profits when our members do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Software engineers at Even build the products &amp;amp; systems that serve our members and run our company. Besides writing, reviewing, and shipping code, we collaborate deeply with others across the company, from product, design, and data to sales, compliance, and customer support.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our stack is primarily Go + PostgreSQL on the server (running on AWS via Docker) and JavaScript + React Native + GraphQL + Relay on the client (iOS, Android, and web). Experience with these specific technologies isn\u2019t required, but an interest in them certainly helps.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The salary range for this position is $105,000 - $220,000&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;",
